# Telomeres

The fission yeast complete genome sequence currently stops short of the
telomeric repeats. See the [Sequencing
Status](status/sequencing-status) page for the current assembly status.

The most proximal anchored cosmids to each telomere are (links
to genome browser):

-   Chromosome I left c212 (coordinates
    [1-29663](http://genomebrowser.pombase.org/Schizosaccharomyces_pombe/Location/View?r=I%3A1-29663;site=ensemblunit))
-   Cromosome I right c750
    ([5554844-5579133](http://genomebrowser.pombase.org/Schizosaccharomyces_pombe/Location/View?r=I%3A5554844-5579133;site=ensemblunit))
-   Chromosome II left c1348
    ([1-39186](http://genomebrowser.pombase.org/Schizosaccharomyces_pombe/Location/View?r=II%3A1-39186;site=ensemblunit))
-   Chromosome II right pT2R1
    ([4500619-4539800](http://genomebrowser.pombase.org/Schizosaccharomyces_pombe/Location/View?r=II%3A4500619-4539800;site=ensemblunit))
-   There are no telomere proximal clones for chromosome III as the
    unsequenced rDNA blocks occur inbetween the sequenced portion and
    the telomeres on both chromosome arms.

Details of all clones used for the assembly, and their order, length and
overlap details is provided in a set of
[spreadsheets](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pombase/pombe/Archived_directories/Cosmid_assembly_data/)
available from the *S. pombe* FTP site.

A contig extending the left arm of Chromosome II was sequenced by
Sasaki *et al.*
([PMID:18727152](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=18727152))
and will be attached to the assembly in the next round of sequence
changes. In the meantime, the contig can be viewed in the
[PomBase Genome Browser](http://genomebrowser.pombase.org/Schizosaccharomyces_pombe/Location/View?g=SPBC460.01c;r=AB325691:1479-3197;t=SPBC460.01c.1).

A set of [small insert clones](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/yeast/sequences/pombe/telomeres/)
(FTP link; also see table) from a telomere plasmid library has been
made available by [Neal Sugawara](mailto:sugawara@hydra.rose.brandeis.edu). None can be
assigned to a chromosome at present.

Clones included in the final sequence are available from the Wellcome
Trust Sanger Institute; send email to <archives@sanger.ac.uk>

**Table notes:**\
"Terminal" refers to the position adjacent to the vector sequences of
pMLC12 where the blunt end (SmaI end) ligated to the
telomeric sequences. "Internal" means that an *S. pombe*
sequence intervenes between the telomere and vector sequences.
