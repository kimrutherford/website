## Centromeres

At present, each centromere is annotated as a single sequence
feature in PomBase, which can be viewed in and downloaded from the
Ensembl genome browser.

Chromosome coordinates (links to Ensembl genome browser):

-   CEN 1: [I:3753687-3789421](http://fungi.ensembl.org/Schizosaccharomyces_pombe/Location/View?r=I%3A3753687-3789421;site=ensemblunit)
-   CEN 2: [II:1602264-1644747](http://fungi.ensembl.org/Schizosaccharomyces_pombe/Location/View?r=II%3A1602264-1644747;site=ensemblunit)
-   CEN 3: [III:1070904-1137003](http://fungi.ensembl.org/Schizosaccharomyces_pombe/Location/View?r=III%3A1070904-1137003;site=ensemblunit)

The 3 centromeres are also available as contiguated sequence (the
remaining gaps in CEN2 and CEN3 are represented by 100 N's)

-   [CEN 1](ftp://ftp.pombase.org/pombe/genome_sequence_and_features/feature_sequences/centromeres/cen1.gz) (gzipped EMBL format)
-   [CEN 2](ftp://ftp.pombase.org/pombe/genome_sequence_and_features/feature_sequences/centromeres/cen2.gz) (gzipped EMBL format)
-   [CEN 3](ftp://ftp.pombase.org/pombe/genome_sequence_and_features/feature_sequences/centromeres/cen3.gz) (gzipped EMBL format)

Note that specific repeats within centromeres cannot yet be viewed or
searched as features on PomBase pages, but they can be displayed on
tracks in the genome browser. Turn on any or all of "PomBase Annotated
Centromeric Inner Repeat Region (SO:0001798)", "PomBase Annotated dg
Repeat (SO:0001898)" or "PomBase Annotated dh Repeat (SO:0001899)" (see
the [browser track FAQ](http://www.pombase.org/faqs/how-can-i-show-or-hide-tracks-in-the-genome-browser) for
instructions).

Repeats are also shown in the diagram below. To see the repeat
sequences, download and unzip the [contiguated sequence files](ftp://ftp.pombase.org/pombe/genome_sequence_and_features/artemis_files/)
and view them in
[Artemis](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/artemis). (See
[this FAQ](http://www.pombase.org/faqs/is-there-an-equivalent-to-the-artemis-java-applet-in-pombase) for more
information.)

**Note:** Recent work by Chad Ellermeier and Gerry Smith suggests that
there are only 4 +/- 1 copies of the 6760 bp repeat missing from
chromosome 3

constructs.
