Gene Characterisation Status Descriptions
-----------------------------------------

**Experimentally characterised:** Completely or partially characterised
in a small scale experiment, with some published information about the
biological role (corresponding to any of the [fission yeast GO
slim](browse-curation/fission-yeast-go-slim-terms) biological process
terms)

**Role inferred from homology:** A biological role (as above, a [fission
yeast GO slim](browse-curation/fission-yeast-go-slim-terms) term) is
inferred from homology to an experimentally characterised gene product

**Conserved protein (unknown biological role):** Conserved outside the
*Schizosaccharomyces*, but nothing known about the biological role in
any organism

***Schizosaccharomyces* **specific protein, uncharacterised**:**
Unpublished and found only in fission yeast (*S. pombe*, *S. octosporus,
*S. japonicus, S. cryophilus**); nothing known about biological role.
May be single copy or a member of a multi-member family.

*****S. pombe* **specific protein, uncharacterised:** Unpublished and
found only in *S. pombe *(not detected in other *Schizosaccharomyces*
species); nothing known about biological role

**Dubious:** Unlikely to be protein coding

Note: You can retrieve current lists of genes with each characterisation
status using the [Advanced Search](http://www.pombase.org/spombe/query/builder). Select the
Annotation Status filter, then choose a status from the pulldown menu,
and submit.
