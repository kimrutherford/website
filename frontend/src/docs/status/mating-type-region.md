## Mating type region

The *S. pombe* mating type region is located on Chromosome 2 (for 972
h-, the coordinates are
[II:2129208-2137121](http://fungi.ensembl.org/Schizosaccharomyces_pombe/Location/View?r=II%3A2129208-2137121;site=ensemblunit)).
This sequence represents a version of the mat2P-mat3M region in which
mat2P and the cenH element are deleted.

A contig of the h90 configuration of the mat2P-mat3M region was
created by Xavier Marsellach and Lorena Aguilar (Azor√≠n lab) using
available data and *S. pombe var. kambucha* as a scaffold. The contig
can be viewed in the [Ensembl genome browser](http://fungi.ensembl.org/Schizosaccharomyces_pombe/Location/View?r=MTR:1-20128).
Replacing the Chromosome 2 region spanning coordinates 2129208-2137121
with the separate contig sequence yields the Chromosome 2 contig of an
h90 strain.
