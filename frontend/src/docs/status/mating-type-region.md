## Mating type region

The *S. pombe* mating type region is located on Chromosome 2 (for 972
h-, the coordinates are
[II:2129208-2137121](https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/?loc=II%3A2129210..2137123&tracks=DNA%2CPomBase%20forward%20strand%20features%2CPomBase%20reverse%20strand%20features&highlight=)).
This sequence represents a version of the mat2P-mat3M region in which
mat2P and the cenH element are deleted.

A contig of the h90 configuration of the mat2P-mat3M region was
created by Xavier Marsellach and Lorena Aguilar (Azor√≠n lab) using
available data and *S. pombe var. kambucha* as a scaffold. The contig
can be viewed in the [genome browser](https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/?loc=mating_type_region%3A2013..18114&tracks=DNA%2CPomBase%20forward%20strand%20features%2CPomBase%20reverse%20strand%20features&highlight=).
Replacing the Chromosome 2 region spanning coordinates 2129208-2137121
with the separate contig sequence yields the Chromosome 2 contig of an
h90 strain.
