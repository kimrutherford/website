# Gene Page: Target Of

The Target Of section describes genes that affect the gene of
interest.Â Genes listed under "Target Of" may include upstream regulators
or enzymes that modify the product of the gene of interest. For example,
the "Target Of" annotations for
[cdc2](/spombe/result/SPBC11B10.09#recipext) indicate that it is a
substrate of, and regulated by, the kinase Wee1 and the phosphatase
Cdc25 (among others).

Target Of data are derived by taking the reciprocal of [ontology
annotation extensions](/faqs/what-annotation-extension) (using [GO
annotation extensions](/documentation/gene-page-gene-ontology#ann_ext)
at present; soon to be extended to include
[phenotype](/documentation/gene-page-phenotypes) annotation extensions).
The table includes:

-   Relationship: indicates how the genes are connected. The
    relationship is the reciprocal of the relation used in the
    originating annotation extension, as noted in the [Annotation
    Extension Relation Display
    documentation](/documentation/gene-page-annotation-extension-relation-display).
-   Gene: the gene whose product affects the gene of interest.
-   Product: the targeting gene's product description.
-   Reference (hidden in "summary" view): the source of the annotation.
