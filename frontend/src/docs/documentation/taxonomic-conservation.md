TheÂ Taxonomic Conservation section provides classifiers of taxon
distribution (at the domain/kingdom level) of the product of a
protein-coding gene, which are assigned manually. The classifiers come
from a small controlled vocabulary maintained by PomBase curators. All
applicable terms are assigned to a protein.

**Species Distribution terms**

Species Distribution terms

-   These terms identify the taxonomic groups in which gene product
    ortholog(s) have been identified:
    -   conserved in archaea
    -   conserved in bacteria
    -   conserved in eukaryotes
    -   conserved in fungi
    -   conserved in metazoa
    -   conserved in vertebrates
-   These two terms represent taxon restrictions, and indicate that a
    gene product has not been detected outside these taxa:
    -   conserved in fungi only
    -   conserved in eukaryotes only
-   Other terms
    -   species distribution, Schizosaccharomyces specific - indicates
        that a gene product is only identified in the genus
        *Schizosaccharomyces* at present, but is present in more than
        one species in this genus
    -   species distribution, Schizosaccharomyces pombe specific -
        indicates that a gene product is identified only in *S. pombe*,
        not in any other species even in the *Schizosaccharomyces* genus
    -   no apparent *S. cerevisiae* ortholog - indicates a gene product
        which is conserved at least outside the *Schizosaccharomyces*
        but is absent from *S. cerevisiae*
    -   faster evolving duplicate - indicates that the copy of a gene
        product which has duplicated after the divergence of
        *Schizosaccharomyces* from other yeasts is evolving faster than
        its duplicate partner (judged because the fission yeast
        duplicate is more closely related to the orthologs in other
        species, but is the best hit of this gene product)
    -   predominantly single copy (one to one) - the gene product is
        conserved largely one-to one across species with minor
        exceptions (for example, frequently duplicated in the vertebrate
        lineage)
    -   orthologs cannot be distinguished - the gene product appears to
        be conserved, but it is not possible to identify orthologs
        unambiguously

**Additional notes:**

-   Any term which has "conserved in fungi" but does *not* have "no
    apparent *S. cerevisiae* ortholog" will have a manually annotated
    *S. cerevisiae* ortholog.
-   Any gene product which is annotated as "conserved in vertebrates"
    will have a manually annotated human ortholog.
-   Note that this section was previously called "species distribution";
    it has been changed to avoid confusion with the correct usage (in
    ecology, the geographical range where a species is found).
