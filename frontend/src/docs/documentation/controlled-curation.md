## PomBase controlled curation

Gene and publication pages include manually curated annotations of
several types that cannot be represented using available ontologies.

For each annotation, the summary view shows a text description, which
corresponds to an entry in the internal
<!-- [/faq/what-pbo-option-advanced-search](PBO) -->
PB term set. The detailed view adds the PBO ID, evidence (if available),
reference, and count. The count links to the [ontology term page](/documentation/ontology-term-page) 
for the description.

Links in the left-hand navigation menu include:

- **Complementation** - Indicates that an _S. pombe_ gene complements,
    or is complemented by, a gene from another species

- **Disease association** - Indicates that the gene's human ortholog
    has been implicated in disease

- **Miscellaneous**

- **Warnings** - Alerts to changes or anomalies that can affect
    interpretation of experimental results, such as changes to the
    sequence or feature annotation

In the Miscellaneous category, annotations fall under one of these
sub-headings:

- **Catalytic activity attributes:** Features of a gene product's
    catalytic activity, such as K<sub>M</sub>, k<sub>cat</sub>,
    substrate specificity

- **Experimental tools:** Indicates that the gene or its product is
    used as an experimental tool (e.g. reporter gene construct,
    selectable marker, antibody)

- **Genome organization:** Attributes of the genomic region around the
    gene, e.g. duplications, repeats, alternative transcripts

- **Miscellaneous functional group:** Function-related descriptions
    that are not covered by GO molecular function or biological
    process annotations

- **Comment:** Experimental observations and other notes that do not
    fit into ontologies or any of the above controlled curation
    categories; truly miscellaneous but interesting information
