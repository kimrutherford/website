# Genetic and Physical Interactions

The Interactions section of a gene page displays genetic and physical
interactions for a gene (or its product), in
[BioGRID](http://thebiogrid.org/) format. All interactions are curated
manually by PomBase or BioGRID curators.

Each table has five columns:

The first column (with no header) describes the interaction. The text
reflects the type of evidence listed in the Evidence column and, where
applicable, the directionality of the interaction.

**Gene:** The gene that interacts with the gene of interest, linked to
its gene page

**Product:** The description of the interacting gene's product, from its
gene page

**Evidence:** The type of genetic interaction observed, or the type of
experiment performed to detect a physical interaction. The evidence
categories come from BioGRID, and are described on their [Experimental
Evidence
Codes](http://wiki.thebiogrid.org/doku.php/experimental_systems)
documentation page.

**Reference:** The paper cited to support the interaction
