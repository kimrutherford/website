The Literature section of a gene page lists the papers that have curated
data for the gene or its product.

At the top of the section, there is a link to search PubMed for any
papers on the gene. This may retrieve papers not on the gene page
Literature list, if there are papers not yet curated (or spurious
matches to the search criteria).

For each paper, the full citation and the number of genes curated from
the paper are shown, and a "Details" link goes to the [publication
page](/documentation/publication_page.md).

By default, the list is sorted alphabetically by first author. Use the
"Sort by" links to change the order.
