The Literature section of a gene page lists the papers that have curated
data for the gene or its product.

At the top of the section, there are links to search PubMed or UK PMC
for any papers on the gene. This may retrieve papers not on the gene
page Literature list, if there are papers not yet curated (or spurious
matches to the search criteria).

For each paper, the full citation is shown, and links to the paper's
record in PubMed and Europe PMC are provided. At present, the list is
sorted alphabetically by first author.

If you reach the Literature section by clicking a reference link
elsewhere on the gene page, the selected reference will be highlighted
by a coloured background.
