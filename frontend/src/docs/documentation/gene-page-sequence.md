# Gene Page: Sequence

The Sequence section of a gene page provides a widget to download DNA
sequences for any gene, and amino acid sequences for protein-coding
genes, as well as links to send sequences to BLAST. For protein-coding
genes, the DNA sequence of the coding exon(s) is displayed by default.

1.  Toggle to show the amino acid sequence (not available for
    non-coding RNA genes).

2.  Controls to add UTRs, introns, or flanking sequences to the
    displayed sequence. For upstream or downstream sequence, use the
    up/down control to increment by one base, or type or paste a
    number in the box.

3.  The sequence header indicates what is included.

4.  Link to save the displayed sequence to a file.

5.  Links to send the displayed sequence to BLAST at
    [NCBI](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) or
    [Ensembl](http://fungi.ensembl.org/Multi/Tools/Blast?db=core). DNA
    sequences link to BLASTN by default.

When the "Show translation" option is selected, irrelevant controls
are hidden and BLASTP links are shown:
