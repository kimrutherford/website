## GO Slims - Gene Ontology subsets

"GO slims" are subsets of the Gene Ontology (GO) that provide a broad
overview of annotation distribution. Slims can offer a useful overview
of a genome or the results of a large-scale experiment. For more
information on GO slims, please see PomBase [GO Slimming Tips](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-go-slimming-tips) and the [GO Slim
Guide](http://www.geneontology.org/GO.slims.shtml) at the Gene Ontology
website.

The [GO slim term set](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-go-slim-terms)
constructed for fission yeast provides almost complete coverage of gene
products annotated to biological process terms. This slim set is a good
starting point for users who wish to identify terms of biological
interest to create a "custom slim", or to become familiar with the
genome contents.

In the GO slim [table](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-go-slim-terms), GO
IDs link to the QuickGO browser, where you can explore the ontology and
annotations further. The annotation totals include annotations to the
slim term and to descendants following the *is\_a*, *part\_of,
regulates, positively\_regulates,*and *negatively\_regulates*
relationships, and link to gene lists.
