# Simple search

The simple search is available via the search box in the header on every
PomBase page.

It searches gene names (standard names and synonyms), systematic IDs,
and gene product descriptions for fission yeast genes. Human and
budding yeast orthologs can also be searched by standard gene name and
ORF name, respectively.

Start typing to see a pulldown of autocomplete matches, then choose
one, or if there is a single match simply hit return, to go to the
matching gene page.
