# Ontology term pages

For each ontology term loaded into PomBase, a page summarizes essential
details about the term, and lists genes annotated to it or its
descendants:

![ontology term
page](/sites/pombase.org/files/images/ontology_term_page.png){width="800"
height="488"}

1.  Ontology term details. The term's name and, where applicable, ID,
    definition and synonyms are shown.
2.  Links to external browsers are available for some ontologies. GO and
    FYPO terms have links to
    [BioPortal](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/), and GO term pages
    also link to [AmiGO](http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo) and
    [QuickGO](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/). SO IDs link to
    [MISO](http://sequenceontology.org/browser/obob.cgi).
3.  Link to the Advanced Search with the gene list (see 4 below) loaded
    into the Gene ID filter.
4.  List of genes annotated to the term or its descendants.

Ontology term pages are available for [GO](http://geneontology.org/),
[FYPO](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-phenotype-ontology),
[SO](http://sequenceontology.org/),
[PSI-MOD](http://www.psidev.info/MOD) and
[PBO](http://dev.pombase.org/faqs/what-pbo-option-advanced-search). The
internal ontology we use for phenotype experimental conditions, PECO,
has minimal term pages with term names and IDs.
