## Gene page: Basic information

At the top of each gene page is a set of basic information about the
gene:

1.  See the [Gene Name Registry](/submit-data/gene-name-registry) for
    more information about *S. pombe* gene names. Synonyms include all
    names other than the standard name that have been published for a
    gene, and thus are not guaranteed to be unique.
2.  Free text description of the gene product
3.  Chromosome coordinates for the gene. For protein-coding genes, the
    first set of numbers indicate the gene start, end, and length
    including the default UTRs chosen by PomBase curators 
    (see [this FAQ](/faq/how-do-you-determine-genes-full-length-transcript-utr-coordinates-transcription-start-and-end-s)
    for more information). The "CDS" numbers give the start, end, and
    length excluding UTRs but including introns (other than introns
    located entirely within UTRs).
4.  What the three-letter acronym stands for; where available, name
    descriptions are provided for synonyms as well as primary names.
5.  Category describing how well-studied a gene is; see the 
    [Gene Characterisation](/status/gene-characterisation) page for details
6.  Indicates whether a gene encodes protein, specifies a non-coding
    RNA, or is a pseudogene
7.  The size of the mature gene product. For protein-coding genes, the
    length (number of amino acid residues) and molecular weight are
    shown.
8.  Static graphic from the PomBase Genome Browser showing the region
    around the gene
9.  Link to the PomBase Genome Browser, centred on the location of the
    gene
10. Links to gene pages for nearby genes
