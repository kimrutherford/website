The External References section of a gene page provides links to
information on a gene or its product in each of several external
databases. For each database, a category, the name and a brief
description are shown, and the identifier used by the database is
displayed and linked.

The resources linked in this section cover a wide range of databases
and data tyeps. Because all are external, PomBase staff cannot provide
assistance with any of the resources other than problems with the
actual links.
