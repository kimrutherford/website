# Can I download all S. pombe phenotype data?
<!-- pombase_categories: Datasets,Querying/Searching,Using Ontologies -->

Yes, the [Phenotype annotations](/downloads/phenotype-annotations) page
offers two options, a complete phenotype annotation file and a
"viability summary" for deletion mutants. At present, the full file
contains all manually curated single mutant phenotypes, and is in the
same format as PomBase uses for bulk phenotype data submissions (see the
[file formats FAQ](/faq/what-file-formats-can-i-use-submit-high-throughput-data)).
Further information on the viability summary is available in the
[essential genes FAQ](/faq/can-i-get-list-essential-pombe-genes).
