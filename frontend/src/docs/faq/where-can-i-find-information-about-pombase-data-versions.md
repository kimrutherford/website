# Where can I find information about PomBase data versions?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome Statistics and Lists -->

The current PomBase version and release date are displayed at the bottom
of each gene page. The version number has two parts, of which the first
is the Ensembl Genomes (EG) version and the second is the version of
curated PomBase annotations (sequence features, ontology annotations,
etc.). For example, PomBase version 20\_39 uses EG version 20 and
PomBase annotation data version 39.\
\
TheÂ  [Data Version History](/about/version-history)page shows additional
information about the versions of various data and software portions of
the current PomBase release. A table of historical values is also
included.
