# Do you have polyadenylation data for fission yeast?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data -->

PomBase offers two ways to find polyadenylation sites and usage:

Fission yeast polyadenylation data are available in the genome browser.
To display the data:

1.  From any gene page, click the "View in Genome Browser" link.
2.  Go to "Configure this page" option in the left-hand menu.
3.  Select "Polyadenylation sites" in the left-hand menu of the popup
    window. Select the tracks you want to show, then click the "tick" in
    the corner.

[Further help with configuring browser tracks](/faq/how-can-i-show-or-hide-tracks-in-the-genome-browser) is available.
