# Can I retrieve the sequence for any of the cosmids used to build the S. pombe genome sequence?
<!-- pombase_categories: Sequence Retrieval,Tools and Resources -->

Although old cosmid sequences used in the reference assembly are not
available in PomBase directly, they are all stored in the International
Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration database (ENA, GenBank, DDBJ)
archives. For ease of searching, PomBase curators recommend finding the
accession, e.g. AL137130,Â  for a cosmid, and using GenBank to retrieve
the sequence:\
\
Go to <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/>(or choose "Nucleotide"
in the search pull-down menu on any NCBI search page). Enter the
accession. The resulting page will inform you that the sequence has been
replaced by one of the whole-chromosome entries, but offers links to
both the current chromosome entry and the obsolete contig entry.
