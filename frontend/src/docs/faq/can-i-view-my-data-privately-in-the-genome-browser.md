# Can I view my data privately in the genome browser?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome browser -->

Yes, if you have locally stored data that you want to see in the context
of the genome browser, you can add it as a custom track. The 
[Ensembl documentation on adding custom tracks](http://genomebrowser.pombase.org/info/website/upload/index.html)
describes supported file formats, options for uploading or linking
your data, and instructions on using the web interface to configure
your tracks.
