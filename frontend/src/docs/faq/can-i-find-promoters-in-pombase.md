# Can I find promoters in PomBase?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data -->

There are very few manually curated promoters in PomBase; they are
included in the forward and reverse strand feature tracks, which are
enabled by default. To search the manually curated promoters, we
suggest that you use Artemis. Follow the instructions in 
[this FAQ](/faq/there-equivalent-artemis-java-applet-pombase), 
and search for features with "Key" = "promoter".

At present, there are also no promoter datasets available as tracks in
PomBase JBrowse.

We will soon add some transcription start site datasets, including one
that was included in the previous version of the PomBase genome
browser, from from Li *et al.* (2015) Genome-wide analysis of core
promoter structures in *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* with DeepCAGE. RNA
Biol. 12:525-37
([PMID:25747261](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25747261)).

We will also add any promoter data sets that are submitted to us.

The PomBase genome browser includes a data track of core promoter
locations from Li *et al.* (2015) Genome-wide analysis of core promoter
structures in *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* with DeepCAGE. RNA Biol.
12:525-37 ([PMID:25747261](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25747261)).

 The
promoter track is listed under the Transcription Starts Site menu, and
is best viewed using the "Labels" track style, which labels promoter
features using the associated gene IDs (see the
[browser configuration FAQ](/faq/how-can-i-show-or-hide-tracks-genome-browser) for more
information).
