# Can I find promoters in PomBase?

The PomBase genome browser includes a data track of core promoter
locations from Li *et al.* (2015) Genome-wide analysis of core promoter
structures in *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* with DeepCAGE. RNA Biol.
12:525-37 ([PMID:25747261](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25747261)).

The previous version of the PomBase genome browser included a data track of core promoter
locations from Li *et al.* (2015) Genome-wide analysis of core promoter
structures in *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* with DeepCAGE. RNA Biol.
12:525-37 ([PMID:25747261](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25747261)). We will soon add this track to PomBase JBrowse.

 The
promoter track is listed under the Transcription Starts Site menu, and
is best viewed using the "Labels" track style, which labels promoter
features using the associated gene IDs (see the
[browser configuration FAQ](/faq/how-can-i-show-or-hide-tracks-genome-browser) for more
information).
-->

We will add new tracks for any more promoter data sets that are
submitted to us.

There are very few manually curated promoters in PomBase; they are
included in the forward and reverse strand feature tracks, which are
enabled by default. To search the manually curated promoters, we
suggest that you use Artemis. Follow the instructions in 
[this FAQ](/faq/there-equivalent-artemis-java-applet-pombase), 
and search for features with "Key" = "promoter".
