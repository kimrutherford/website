# Can I find promoters in PomBase?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data -->

There are very few manually curated promoters in PomBase; they are
included in the forward and reverse strand feature tracks, which are
enabled by default. To search the manually curated promoters, we
suggest that you use Artemis. Follow the instructions in 
[this FAQ](/faq/there-equivalent-artemis-java-applet-pombase), 
and search for features with "Key" = "promoter".

Computationally identified matches to the [DNA binding sites](https://www.pombase.org/browse-curation/dna-binding-sites)

found in *S. pombe* are avaliable as a data track in PomBase
JBrowse. To launch JBrowse with the track loaded, use
[this link](https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/?loc=I%3A2518981..2531220&tracks=DNA%20sequence%2CPomBase%20forward%20strand%20features%2CPomBase%20reverse%20strand%20features%2CConsensus%20promoters%20(computationally%20matched)&highlight=).

We will also soon add some transcription start site datasets,
including one that was included in the previous version of the PomBase
genome browser, from Li *et al.* (2015) Genome-wide analysis of core
promoter structures in *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* with DeepCAGE. RNA
Biol. 12:525-37
([PMID:25747261](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25747261)).

We will also add any promoter data sets that are submitted to us.
