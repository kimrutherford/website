# Can I find promoters in PomBase?
<!-- pombase_categories: Datasets,Querying/Searching -->

The PomBase genome browser includes a data track of core promoter
locations from Li et al. (2015) Genome-wide analysis of core promoter
structures in Schizosaccharomyces pombe with DeepCAGE. RNA Biol.
12:525-37.
[PMID:25747261](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25747261). The
promoter track is listed under the Regulatory Elements menu, and is best
viewed using the "Labels" track style, which labels promoter features
using the associated gene IDs (see the [browser configuration FAQ](/faq/how-can-i-show-or-hide-tracks-genome-browser) for more
information).\
\
We will add new tracks for any more promoter data sets that are
submitted to us.\
\
There are very few manually curated promoters in PomBase, which are
displayed on a genome browser track, "PomBase Annotated Promoter
(SO:0000167)". This track is under the Sequence and assembly menu, and
is activated in the default configuration. To search the manually
curated promoters, we suggest that you use Artemis. Follow the
instructions in [this FAQ](/faq/there-equivalent-artemis-java-applet-pombase), and search for
features with "Key" = "promoter".\
