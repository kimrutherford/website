# What is GO term enrichment? How can I do it for my genes?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data,Tools and resources,Using ontologies -->

"GO term enrichment" refers to analysing a gene list by finding GO terms
that are significantly over- or under-represented among the annotations
for the genes. Finding GO terms that are shared by genes in your list
can help you find out what they have in common biologically.

PomBase does not have its own GO enrichment tool, but we recommend one,
and provide a bit more information, in the [FAQ on GO term enrichment](/faq/how-can-i-find-significant-shared-go-annotations-for-genes-in-a-list).
