# What is GO term enrichment? How can I do it for my genes?
<!-- pombase_categories: Querying/Searching,Tools and Resources,Using Ontologies -->

"GO term enrichment" refers to analysing a gene list by finding GO terms
that are significantly over- or under-represented among the annotations
for the genes. Finding GO terms that are shared by genes in your list
can help you find out what they have in common biologically.\
\
PomBase does not have its own GO enrichment tool, but we recommend one,
and provide a bit more information, in the [FAQ on GO term enrichment](/faq/how-can-i-find-significant-shared-go-annotations-genes-in-a-list).
