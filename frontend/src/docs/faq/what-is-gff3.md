# What is GFF3?
<!-- pombase_categories: Data Submission and Formats -->

Generic Feature Format Version 3 (GFF3) is a tab-delimited text file
format used to represent genomic sequence features.

PomBase produces a GFF3 [file of *S. pombe*sequence features](ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/fungi/current/gff3/schizosaccharomyces_pombe/),
and accepts high-throughput data submissions in this format.

The [file format specification](http://www.sequenceontology.org/resources/gff3.html) is
available from the [Sequence Ontology](http://www.sequenceontology.org/) web site, which also provides
a link to validation software.
