# How can I search or browse GO annotations?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data,Using ontologies -->

You can search for GO terms by name or ID in the PomBase [advanced
search](/query), and retrieve a list of all genes annotated to the
term and its descendants via the relations *is\_a*, *part\_of*,
*regulates*, *positively\_regulates,* and *negatively\_regulates*. For
example, a search for "cytokinesis" will include genes annotated to
"regulation of cytokinesis". (See the GO documentation on [Ontology Structure](http://geneontology.org/page/ontology-structure) and
[Ontology Relations](http://geneontology.org/page/ontology-relations)
for more information.)

*S. pombe* GO annotations are also available in browsers that use the GO
repository, notably [AmiGO](http://amigo.geneontology.org/) and
[QuickGO](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/). Both browsers have extensive
documentation available:

-   [AmiGO Manual](http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/AmiGO_2_Manual:_Overview) 
-   [QuickGO Help page](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/help.html) 

Hint: to find *S. pombe* annotations, use Organism:
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Taxon: 4896 (*Schizosaccharomyces pombe*)
or Source: PomBase. You can download the results in GAF format.

In PomBase, GO term names and IDs on gene pages link to ontology term
pages for GO terms, which in turn offer links to AmiGO, QuickGO and
BioPortal.
