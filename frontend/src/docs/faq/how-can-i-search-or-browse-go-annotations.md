# How can I search or browse GO annotations?
<!-- pombase_categories: Querying/Searching,Using Ontologies -->

You can search for GO terms by name or ID in the PomBase [Advanced Search](/spombe/query/builder), and retrieve a list of all genes
annotated to the term and its descendants via the relations *is\_a*,
*part\_of, regulates, positively\_regulates,*and
*negatively\_regulates*. For example, a search for "cytokinesis" will
include genes annotated to "regulation of cytokinesis". (See the GO
documentation on [Ontology Structure](http://geneontology.org/page/ontology-structure) and [Ontology Relations](http://geneontology.org/page/ontology-relations) for more
information.) **

*S. pombe*GO annotations are also available in browsers that use the GO
repository, notably [AmiGO](http://amigo.geneontology.org/) and
[QuickGO](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/). Both browsers have extensive
documentation available:

-   [AmiGO     Manual](http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/AmiGO_Manual:_Overview) 
-   [QuickGO Help page](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/help.html) 

Hint: to find *S. pombe*annotations, use Taxon: 4896 (
*Schizosaccharomyces pombe*) or Source: PomBase. You can download the
results in GAF format.

In PomBase, GO IDs on gene pages link to QuickGO, and ontology detail
pages for GO terms offer links to both AmiGO and QuickGO.
