# Can I view nucleotide sequence in the genome browser?

Yes. First, make sure sequence display is "on":

1.  From the Location tab click on the "Configure this Page"
2.  In the left hand menu of the pop-up, click on "Sequence and
    assembly"
3.  If the box next to "Sequence" is blank, click it

(also see the [FAQ on configuring
tracks](/faqs/how-can-i-show-or-hide-tracks-genome-browser)).

The Location tab shows two graphics. Between the two images there is a
slider that controls the zoom. Click the '+' or drag the vertical bar to
the left to zoom in. The lower graphic will first display colored blocks
representing color-coded nucleotides, and then, at maximum zoom, legible
sequence. (Note that the vertical bar may appear to be all the way to
the left of the slider before you actually zoom in enough to read the
sequence; keep clicking '+' if necessary.)

At any zoom level, use the arrows flanking the zoom slider to scroll
along the sequence.
