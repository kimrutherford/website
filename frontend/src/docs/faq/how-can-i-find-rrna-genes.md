<!-- pombase_categories: Querying/Searching,Sequence Retrieval -->

Go to the Advanced Search - http://www.pombase.org/spombe/query/builder\
Under "Select Filter" choose "Genes By Type", then choose "rRNA". Click
"Submit". You can download the resulting list of genes or the genomic
sequences. Also see the [FAQ on retrieving sequence
coordinates](/faq/how-can-i-retrieve-sequence-coordinates-all-features-particular-type).

Also see the FAQ on [rDNA
sequences](/faq/are-there-any-rdna-repeat-sequences-pombase).
