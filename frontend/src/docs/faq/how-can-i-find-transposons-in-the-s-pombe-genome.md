# How can I find transposons in the S. pombe genome?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data,Tools and resources -->

In the [advanced search](/query), click "Characterisation status",
then select "transposon" from the pulldown.

At present, there are 11 full-length transposons annotated, and two
frameshifted copies.

Lone LTRs are also annotated as sequence features. They cannot yet be
retrieved by the simple or advanced searches, but they can be displayed
on a [track in the Ensembl browser](/faq/how-can-i-show-or-hide-tracks-in-the-genome-browser) 
(under "Repeats").

Finally, if you wish to install Artemis (available from
http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/artemis), you can use it to view
LTRs in more detail. Read in the EMBL format files of sequence and
annotation (available from the [Genome Feature Annotations](/downloads/genome-datasets) page). To see LTRs,

1.  In the Select menu, choose "By Key".
2.  In the pulldown that pops up, choose "LTR".

See the [Artemis FAQ](/faq/is-there-an-equivalent-to-the-artemis-java-applet-in-pombase) and the 
[Artemis manual](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/resources/software/artemis/artemis.pdf) (pdf;
Sanger site) for additional information.
