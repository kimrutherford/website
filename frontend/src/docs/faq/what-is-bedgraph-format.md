# What is bedGraph format?
<!-- pombase_categories: Data Submission and Formats -->

BedGraph is a file format that allows display of continuous-valued data
in a genome browser track.\
\
BedGraphÂ format is described at the [UCSC Genome Bioinformatics web
site](http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bedgraph.html), and the
[Broad Institute file format
guide](http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/bedgraph)provides
additional information.

If you have strand-specific data that can be represented in bedGraph
format, we recommend submitting two bedGraph files, one per strand.
