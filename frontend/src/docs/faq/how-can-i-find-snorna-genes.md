# How can I find snoRNA genes?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data,Sequence Retrieval -->

In the [advanced search](/query), click "Product type", then select
"snoRNA" from the pulldown.

Note that there are likely a number of snoRNAs that have not yet been
identified and annotated in *S. pombe*; we hope to investigate further
in the future.
