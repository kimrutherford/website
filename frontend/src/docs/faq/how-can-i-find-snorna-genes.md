# How can I find snoRNA genes?
<!-- pombase_categories: Querying/Searching,Sequence Retrieval -->

Go to the Advanced Search - http://www.pombase.org/spombe/query/builder\
Under "Select Filter" choose "Genes By Type", then choose "snoRNA".
Click "Submit". You can download the resulting list of genes or the
genomic sequences. Also see the [FAQ on retrieving sequence coordinates](/faq/how-can-i-retrieve-sequence-coordinates-all-features-particular-type).

Note that there are likely a number of snoRNAs that have not yet been
identified and annotated in *S. pombe*; we hope to investigate further
in the future.
