# Are there any rDNA repeat sequences in PomBase?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome Browser,Locating Genomic Regions,Sequence Retrieval -->

The reference genome sequence excludes most of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA)
repeats, which are present in two tandem arrays on chromosome III. These
arrays are estimated to be 1225 kb and 240 kb in size for the sequenced
strain (972 h-). The reference sequence includes two partial and one
complete representative rDNA repeats:

-   At the left-hand end a partial repeat contains
    [SPRRNA.42](http://www.pombase.org/spombe/result/SPRRNA.42)(partial
    18S gene)
-   A complete repeat contains
    [SPRRNA.47](http://www.pombase.org/spombe/result/SPRRNA.47)(28S),
    [SPRRNA.50](http://www.pombase.org/spombe/result/SPRRNA.50)(5.8S),
    and [SPRRNA.43](http://www.pombase.org/spombe/result/SPRRNA.43)(18S)
-   A partial repeat at the right-hand end contains
    [SPRRNA.45](http://www.pombase.org/spombe/result/SPRRNA.45)

The complete repeat sequence coordinates are [Chromosome 3:5542-13722](http://genomebrowser.pombase.org/Schizosaccharomyces_pombe/Location/View?r=III%3A5542-13722)(note
that the reverse strand is transcribed). The link goes to the PomBase
Genome Browser, where you can view and
[download](/faq/how-can-i-retrieve-sequence-region-using-sequence-coordinates)the
sequence. Because the reverse strand is transcribed, you may want to
choose "-1" in the location settings.
