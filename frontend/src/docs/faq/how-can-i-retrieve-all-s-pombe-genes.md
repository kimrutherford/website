# How can I retrieve all S. pombe genes?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome statistics and lists,Finding data -->

The [Names and identifiers page](/downloads/names-and-identifiers)
provides lists of all genes, including non-coding RNA genes. The
allNames.tsv file contains the systematic IDs and names for both
protein-coding and non-coding RNA genes, whereas two separate files
are available that also include product descriptions.

The [advanced search](/query) includes a query that retrieves all
protein-coding genes at once, as decribed in 
[this FAQ](/faq/how-can-i-retrieve-all-s-pombe-protein-coding-genes).
