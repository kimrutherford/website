# What file formats can I use to submit high-throughput data?
<!-- pombase_categories: Data Submission and Formats,Datasets -->

At present, PomBase can host any types of data that can be connected
with sequence features or coordinates, and can display the data as
tracks in the genome browser. We [accept data](/submit-data/data-submission-form) in any of several formats,
listed on the genome browser documentation page on [Adding Custom Tracks to Ensembl](http://genomebrowser.pombase.org/info/website/upload/index.html#formats).
To choose a file format for your data, consult the table below and the
linked FAQs. Please consult the helpdesk if you need further assistance.
[consult the helpdesk](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org) if you need further
assistance.

File format

Recommended for

[BAM](/faq/what-bam-format) 

sequence alignments, especially from high-throughput experiments

[BED](/faq/what-bed-format) 

sequence features with coordinates

[bedGraph](/faq/what-bedgraph-format) 

values attached to genome locations/regions

[bigBed](/faq/what-bigbed-format) 

sequence features with coordinates

[bigWig](/faq/what-bigwig-format) 

values attached to genome locations/regions

[GFF3](/faq/what-gff3) 

sequence features with coordinates

[PSL](/faq/what-psl-format) 

sequence alignments

[VCF](/faq/what-vcf) 

structural variations, such as SNPs, insertions, deletions, or copy
number variants

[WIG](/faq/what-wig-format) 

values attached to genome locations/regions

We can also accept batch submissions of certain types of data that
appear on PomBase gene pages. For these data types, we use dedicated
PomBase-specific formats as shown in the table:

We may be able to accept data in other text formats. Please enquire via
the PomBase helpdesk if you have any questions about your data format.
