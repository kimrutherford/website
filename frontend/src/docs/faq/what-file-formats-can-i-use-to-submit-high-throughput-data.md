# What file formats can I use to submit high-throughput data?
<!-- pombase_categories: Data submission and formats -->

At present, PomBase can host any types of data that can be connected
with sequence features or coordinates, and can display the data as
tracks in the genome browser. We 
accept data in any of several formats.
<!-- [accept data](/submit-data/data-submission-form) in any of several formats. -->
To choose a file format for your data, consult the table below and the
linked FAQs. Please [consult the helpdesk](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org) to submit a file or if you need further
assistance.

File format | Recommended for
------------|----------------
[BAM](/faq/what-bam-format) | sequence alignments, especially from high-throughput experiments
[BED](/faq/what-bed-format) | sequence features with coordinates
[bedGraph](/faq/what-bedgraph-format) | values attached to genome locations/regions
[bigBed](/faq/what-bigbed-format) | sequence features with coordinates
[bigWig](/faq/what-bigwig-format) | values attached to genome locations/regions
[GFF3](/faq/what-gff) | sequence features with coordinates
[PSL](/faq/what-psl-format) | sequence alignments
[VCF](/faq/what-vcf) | structural variations, such as SNPs, insertions, deletions, or copy number variants
[WIG](/faq/what-wig-format) | values attached to genome locations/regions

We can also accept batch submissions of certain types of data that
appear on PomBase gene pages. For these data types, we use dedicated
PomBase-specific formats as shown in the table:

Data type | File format description
----------|------------------------
Phenotypes | [phenotype file format](/documentation/phenotype-data-bulk-upload-format) 
Modifications | [modification file format](/documentation/modification-data-bulk-upload-file-format) 
Qualitative gene expression | [qualitative gene expression file format](/documentation/qualitative-data-gene-expression-bulk-upload-file-format) 
Quantitative gene expression | [quantitative gene expression file format](/documentation/quantitative-data-gene-expression-bulk-upload-file-format) 

We may be able to accept data in other text formats. Please enquire via
the PomBase [helpdesk](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org) if you have any questions about your data format.
