# What file formats can I use to submit high-throughput data?
<!-- pombase_categories: Data submission and formats -->

At present, PomBase can host any types of data that can be connected
with sequence features or coordinates, and can display the data as
tracks in the genome browser. We [accept data](/submit-data/data-submission-form) in any of several formats,
listed on the genome browser documentation page on [Adding Custom Tracks to Ensembl](http://genomebrowser.pombase.org/info/website/upload/index.html#formats).
To choose a file format for your data, consult the table below and the
linked FAQs. Please [consult the helpdesk](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org) if you need further
assistance.

File format | Recommended for
------------|----------------
[BAM](/faq/what-is-bam-format) | sequence alignments, especially from high-throughput experiments
[BED](/faq/what-is-bed-format) | sequence features with coordinates
[bedGraph](/faq/what-is-bedgraph-format) | values attached to genome locations/regions
[bigBed](/faq/what-is-bigbed-format) | sequence features with coordinates
[bigWig](/faq/what-is-bigwig-format) | values attached to genome locations/regions
[GFF3](/faq/what-is-gff3) | sequence features with coordinates
[PSL](/faq/what-is-psl-format) | sequence alignments
[VCF](/faq/what-is-vcf) | structural variations, such as SNPs, insertions, deletions, or copy number variants
[WIG](/faq/what-is-wig-format) | values attached to genome locations/regions

We can also accept batch submissions of certain types of data that
appear on PomBase gene pages. For these data types, we use dedicated
PomBase-specific formats as shown in the table:

Data type | File format description
----------|------------------------
Phenotypes | [phenotype file format](/submit-data/phenotype-data-bulk-upload-format) 
Modifications | [modification file format](/submit-data/modification-bulk-upload-file-format) 
Qualitative gene expression | [qualitative gene expression file format](/submit-data/qualitative-gene-expression-bulk-upload-file-format) 
Quantitative gene expression | [quantitative gene expression file format](/submit-data/quantitative-gene-expression-bulk-upload-file-format) 

We may be able to accept data in other text formats. Please enquire via
the PomBase [helpdesk](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org) if you have any questions about your data format.
