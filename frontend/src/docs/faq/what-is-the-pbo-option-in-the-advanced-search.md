# What is the "PBO" option in the Advanced Search?
<!-- pombase_categories: Querying/Searching,Using Ontologies -->

PBO is an internal set of terms used for various PomBase annotations
that do not fit into any of the other ontologies in use. PBO IDs and
term names can be queried in the Advanced search, and are most useful if
you have noted a term or ID from a gene page. Examples include
complementation annotations (e.g. cdc2 'functionally complemented by H.
sapiens CDK1' PBO:0012584), disease association, and "miscellaneous"
annotations (e.g. pom1 'forms a polar gradient' PBO:0000437).
