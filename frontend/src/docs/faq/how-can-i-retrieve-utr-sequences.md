# How can I retrieve UTR sequences?
<!-- pombase_categories: Datasets,Querying/Searching,Sequence Retrieval -->

Transcript start and end coordinates from all sources will be available
as individual data tracks in the Ensembl genome browser in the near
future, which will allow you to view, evaluate and download them. We
also provide downloadable [UTR data sets](/downloads/utr)that are
updated periodically.\
\
Also see the [precedence
criteria](/faq/how-do-you-determine-genes-full-length-transcript-utr-coordinates-transcription-start-and-end-s)used
to choose default UTR features to display on gene pages.

To retrieve UTRs for a specified list of genes, see the FAQ on
[downloading sequences for multiple
genes](/faq/can-i-download-sequences-many-genes-once-including-flanking-regions)(choose
5' UTR and/or 3' UTR in step 9).
