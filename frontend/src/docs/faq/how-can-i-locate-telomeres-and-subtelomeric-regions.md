# How can I locate telomeres and subtelomeric regions?
<!-- pombase_categories: Locating Genomic Regions -->

The current *S. pombe*genome assembly does not include the complete
telomeric regions or the telomeric short repeats. These omissions are
beyond the control of PomBase curators. Subtelomeric repeats are also
not explicitly defined at present, although we hope to provide this
information in the future. Additional information about *S.
pombe*telomeres is available at on the
[Telomeres](/status/telomeres) page (linked via the [Genome Status](/genome-status) menu).
