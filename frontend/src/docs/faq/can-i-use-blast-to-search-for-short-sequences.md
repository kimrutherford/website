# Can I use BLAST to search for short sequences?
<!-- pombase_categories: Querying/Searching,Tools and Resources -->

Yes, you can search for short nucleotide sequences, such as primers or
other oligomers, in the PomBase BLAST. For sequences less than 20 nt
long, however, you may need to change the search sensitivity from
"Normal" to "Short sequences" using the pulldown menu at the bottom of
the query form.
