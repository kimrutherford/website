# How can I retrieve a gene sequence, including upstream and downstream sequences?
<!-- pombase_categories: Gene page,Genome browser,Finding data -->

You can retrieve sequences from a gene page or in the Genome Browser.

On the gene page: Scroll down or click the left-hand menu link to the
Sequence section of the page, where a DNA sequence is displayed by
default. For protein-coding genes, the CDS is shown, and you can click
boxes to add the sequences of any annotated introns or 5' or 3'
UTRs. To include flanking sequences, enter a number of nucleotides in
the "upstream" and/or "downstream" boxes. Only applicable options
appear for non-coding RNA genes. The "Download sequence" button saves
a FASTA file with your selection.

**To use the Genome Browser**: Click the "View in Genome Browser" link
under the map graphic on a gene page. Click Export Data (a button on
the left hand side). Select the number of bases up- and downstream,
which strand and the features you would like. Click "next". Select
your download option. Your browser will save or display the data,
depending on which format you select.

To retrieve flanking regions for more than one gene at a time, at
present you must use the Ensembl Genomes Biomart query, as described in
[this FAQ](/faq/can-i-download-sequences-many-genes-once-including-flanking-regions).
