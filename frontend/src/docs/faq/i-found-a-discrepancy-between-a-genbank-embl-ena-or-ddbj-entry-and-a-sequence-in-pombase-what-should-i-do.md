# I found a discrepancy between a GenBank (EMBL/ENA or DDBJ) entry and a sequence in Pombase. What should I do?
<!-- pombase_categories: Querying/Searching,Sequence Retrieval -->

We recommend using only the genome sequence, either from PomBase
[downloadable files](/downloads/genome-datasets)or from the [sequence
retrieval
tools](/faqs/how-can-i-retrieve-gene-sequence-including-upstream-and-downstream-sequences)on
the gene pages and in the genome browser. Although there are some
sequence updates still pending, the genome sequence is more accurate
than individual gene sequences that predate the genome.\
\
Many older *S. pombe*sequence submissions to the DNA databases
(International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration databases,
i.e. ENA, GenBank, DDBJ) contain one or more errors (sometimes with an
error rate as high as 20%), and we do not have the resources to maintain
past sequences or flag every error in PomBase.
