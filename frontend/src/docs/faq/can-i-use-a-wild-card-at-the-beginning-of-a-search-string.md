# Can I use a wild card at the beginning of a search string?
<!-- pombase_categories: Querying/Searching -->

Yes, you can now use \* as a wild card anywhere a search string. You
must have at least three characters (letters, numbers, etc.) in addition
to the wild card.

(Previously, wild cards did not work at the beginning of a search
string, but PomBase now uses a different search technology that supports
wild cards anywhere.)
