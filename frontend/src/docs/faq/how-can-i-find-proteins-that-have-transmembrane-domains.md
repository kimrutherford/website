# How can I find proteins that have transmembrane domains?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data -->

In the [advanced search](/query), use the "Number of TM domains"
query. Enter the minimum and maximum number of domains (use the same
number as minimum and maximum to retrieve proteins with, e.g. exactly
7 transmembrane domains).

<!--
