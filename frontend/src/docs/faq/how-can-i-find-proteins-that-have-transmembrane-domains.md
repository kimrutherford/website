# How can I find proteins that have transmembrane domains?
<!-- pombase_categories: Querying/Searching -->

In the Advanced Search (http://www.pombase.org/spombe/query/builder),
choose " [ Transmembrane]{data-scayt_word="Transmembrane"
data-scaytid="2"}Domains" under the "Protein Filters" heading in the
"Select Filter" [pulldown. Enter the minimum and maximum number of
domains (use the same number as minimum and maximum to retrieve proteins
with, e.g. exactly 7 transmembrane domains)]{data-scayt_word="pulldown"
data-scaytid="3"}, and submit.

Example query: [Genes whose products have 7 transmembrane
domains](/spombe/query/builder?filter=37&value=%5B%7B%22param%22:%7B%22filter_1%22:%7B%22filter%22:%226%22,%22query_1%22:%227%22,%22query_2%22:%227%22%7D%7D,%22filter_count%22:%221%22%7D%5D)
