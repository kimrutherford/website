# How can I find significant shared FYPO annotations for genes in a list?
<!-- pombase_categories: Querying/Searching,Tools and Resources,Using Ontologies -->

FYPO enrichment analysis is analogous to GO term enrichment, using
phenotypes rather than GO annotations, i.e. analysing a gene list by
finding FYPO terms that are significantly over- or under-represented
among the annotations for the genes.\
\
At present, PomBase does not have its own FYPO enrichment tool, and very
few ontology enrichment tools can use phenotype data. One that does is

by Jürg Bähler's lab.
