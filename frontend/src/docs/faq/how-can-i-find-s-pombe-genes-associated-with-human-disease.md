# How can I find S. pombe genes associated with human disease?
<!-- pombase_categories: Orthology,Querying/Searching -->

*S. pombe*genes whose human orthologs have been implicated in disease
are annotated with terms from the internal
[PBO](/faqs/what-pbo-option-advanced-search)vocabulary. To retrieve all
of these genes, you can use the most general "disease associated" term.
To do the query manually:

1.  Go to the Advanced Search ( <http://www.pombase.org/spombe/query>).
2.  Find the term:
    a.  Select the 'PBO Term Name' filter, start typing 'disease
        associated', and choose 'disease\_associated' from the
        autocomplete options; **or**
    b.  Select the 'PBO ID' filter and enter 'PBO:5000000'.
3.  Submit the query.

You can also type all or part of specific disease name (e.g. 'cancer')
into theÂ 'PBO Term Name' filter to see if any matches come up in the
autocomplete suggestions. Also see the FAQs on [finding genes conserved
in human](/faqs/how-can-i-find-all-s-pombe-genes-are-conserved-human),
