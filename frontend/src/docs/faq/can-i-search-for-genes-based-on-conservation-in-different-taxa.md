Yes, use the "Taxonomic conservation" query in the [advanced search](/query).

<!--
Example query: [Genes conserved in vertebrates](/spombe/query/builder?filter=37&value=%5B%7B%22param%22:%7B%22filter_1%22:%7B%22filter%22:%2226%22,%22query%22:%22PBO:0011070%22%7D%7D,%22filter_count%22:%221%22%7D%5D)
