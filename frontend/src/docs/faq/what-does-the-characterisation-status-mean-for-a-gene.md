# What does the "characterisation status" mean for a gene?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome Statistics and Lists -->

Each gene is assigned exactly one [
characterisation]{data-scayt_word="characterisation"
data-scaytid="1"}status that reflects how much is known about the gene,
whether it is conserved, etc. Specific status descriptions:

-   **Experimentally [ characterised]{data-scayt_word="characterised"
    data-scaytid="2"}:**Completely or partially [
    characterised]{data-scayt_word="characterised" data-scaytid="5"}in a
    small scale experiment, with some published information about the
    biological role (corresponding to any of the [fission yeast GO
    slim](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-go-slim-terms)biological
    process terms)
-   **Role inferred from homology:**A biological role (as above, a
    [fission yeast GO
    slim](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-go-slim-terms)term) is inferred
    from homology to an experimentally characterised gene product
-   **Conserved protein (unknown biological role):**Conserved outside
    the *Schizosaccharomyces*, but nothing known about the biological
    role in any organism
-   ***Schizosaccharomyces* specific protein,
    uncharacterised:** Unpublished and found only in fission yeast ( *S.
    pombe*,  *S. octosporus,  *S. japonicus, S. cryophilus** **);
    nothing known about biological role. May be single copy or a member
    of a multi-member family.
-   *******S. pombe* **specific protein,
    uncharacterised**:** Unpublished and found only in  *S. pombe *(not
    detected in other  *Schizosaccharomyces* species); nothing known
    about biological role
-   **Dubious:**Unlikely to be protein coding

A current summary of [gene characterisation status for the *S.
pombe*genome](/status/gene-characterisation)is available, as well as a
table of [historical characterisation
status](/status/gene-characterisation-statistics-history)counts.

You can also retrieve current lists of genes with each characterisation
status using the [Advanced Search](/spombe/query/builder). Select the
Annotation Status filter, then choose a status from the pulldown menu,
and submit.
