# How can I use GO slims with S. pombe?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome Statistics and Lists,Tools and Resources,Using Ontologies -->

The [Fission Yeast GO slim terms](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-go-slim-terms) page provides a
generic GO biological process slim for *S. pombe*, and shows total genes
annotated to each term directly or to any of its descendants.

If you want GO slim annotations for your own list of *S. pombe*genes, we
recommend the [GO Term Mapper](http://go.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/GOTermMapper) at Princeton.
Upload your list of genes, and select "PomBase (S. pombe GOslim)
(Process only)" from the "Choose GO slim" pulldown. GO Term Mapper's
interface and documentation should make the rest straightforward, but
let PomBase staff know if you have any problems.

For further information on using the generic *S. pombe*slim, or on
creating your own GO slim, please see the [Fission Yeast GO slimming tips](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-go-slimming-tips) page.
