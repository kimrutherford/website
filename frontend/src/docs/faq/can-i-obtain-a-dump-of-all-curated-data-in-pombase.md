# Can I obtain a dump of all curated data in PomBase?
<!-- pombase_categories: Datasets,Tools and Resources -->

Data that appear on gene pages -- sequence feature annotations, ontology
annotations, etc. -- are stored in a database that uses the
[Chado](http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado)schema. Dumps from the Chado database
for each PomBase release are available via the
[Downloads](/downloads)page.
