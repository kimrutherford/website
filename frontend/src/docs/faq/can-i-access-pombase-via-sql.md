# Can I access PomBase via SQL?
<!-- pombase_categories: Querying/Searching,Tools and Resources -->

You can use the [Ensembl Genomes (EG) MySQL database
access](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/access/mysql)to query *S.
pombe*data. Note, however, that there is often a time lag in updating
EG, so it may not have data as up-to-date as on the PomBase web site.
MySQL dumps of EG data, including *Schizosaccharomyces*species, are
available from [EG's FTP
site](ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/current/fungi/mysql/). (We plan
to provide MySQL dumps for PomBase releases soon.)\
\
For Chado, we do not have a publicly accessible PostgresQL server.
Instead, you can download [Chado database
dumps](/downloads/chado-database-dumps)to query locally.
