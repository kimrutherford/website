# How can I retrieve sequences for non-protein-coding genes?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data -->

A file of all non-coding RNA gene sequences is available on the 
[Genome sequences page](/downloads/genome-datasets).

If you need sequences for all genes of a single type (tRNAs, rRNAs,
other ncRNAs, etc.) we recommend using the [advanced search](/query)
and results download as described in the 
[FAQ on retrieving sequence coordinates for all features of a particular type](/faq/how-can-i-retrieve-sequence-coordinates-for-all-features-of-a-particular-type).
