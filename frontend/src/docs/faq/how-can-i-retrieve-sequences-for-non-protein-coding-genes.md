# How can I retrieve sequences for non-protein-coding genes?
<!-- pombase_categories: Datasets,Querying/Searching,Sequence Retrieval -->

At present, if you need sequences for all tRNAs, rRNAs, other ncRNAs,
etc. we recommend using the Advanced Search and results download as
described in the [FAQ on retrieving sequence coordinates for all
features of a particular
type](/faq/how-can-i-retrieve-sequence-coordinates-all-features-particular-type).

Downloadable FASTA sequence datasets will be added to the PomBase FTP
site in the near future.
