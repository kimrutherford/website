# Why do gene pages only show curated orthologs for human and S. cerevisiae?
<!-- pombase_categories: Gene Page,Genome Statistics and Lists,Orthology -->

In PomBase, human and *S. cerevisiae* orthologs are manually curated for
*S. pombe* genes as described in the [Manually Curated Orthologs documentation](/documentation/orthologs). Because manual ortholog
curation is extremely time-consuming, it is not done for any species
other than human and *S. cerevisiae*. For automated ortholog prediction
of orthologs in other species please see the [relevant FAQ](/faq/how-can-i-find-s-pombe-orthologs-species-other-human-and-s-cerevisiae).

In the future we will add a tree view of consensus orthologs in key
species to the gene pages.
