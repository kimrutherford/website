# How can I show or hide tracks in the genome browser?
<!-- pombase_categories: Datasets,Genome Browser -->

In the Ensembl genome browser, click the "Configure this page" button in
the left-hand bar. A pop-up box will appear. Note that this box has
several tabs along its top, and the exact selection of tabs and
configuration options depends on whether you are configuring the
"Location", "Gene", or "Transcript" tab of the main browser.\
\
To turn a track on or off, click the small box to the left of its
description. Note that some tracks simply toggle on and off, whereas for
others a small popup appears, in which you can select from a set of
options controlling exactly how the track appears. The left-hand bar of
the configuration popup organizes available tracks into subsets, and
offers a few additional options (including "Reset configuration", which
restores the default display).\
\
For example, to show or hide repeat regions, make sure you have the
"Location" tab selected. The tabs for this configuration allow you to
configure the "Region" (lower) and "Overview" (lower) images separately.
In the "Configure Region Image" tab, click "Repeat regions" in the
popup's left-hand bar. You can then check one box to show all repeats,
or select specific types of repeat to display.\
\
When you are finished choosing tracks, click the tick/check mark in the
upper right corner of the configuration popup.\
