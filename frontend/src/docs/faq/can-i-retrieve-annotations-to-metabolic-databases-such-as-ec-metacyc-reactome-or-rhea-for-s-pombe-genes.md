# Can I retrieve annotations to metabolic databases such as EC, MetaCyc, Reactome, or Rhea for S. pombe genes?
<!-- pombase_categories: Querying/Searching,Using Ontologies -->

The best way to find metabolism-related annotations for *S. pombe*genes
is to use the GO annotation data available from PomBase in combination
with mappings between GO terms and entries in the various
metabolism-oriented databases.\
\
For example, many GO molecular function (MF) terms representing
enzymatic activities are mapped to the corresponding [Enzyme
Commission](http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/)(EC) number for the
reaction, and some are also mapped to entries fromÂ 
[KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/)or from the
[Rhea](http://www.rhea-db.org/home)database of annotated chemical
reactions. GO MF and biological process (BP) terms may be annotated to
reactions or pathways, respectively, in [MetaCyc](http://metacyc.org/)or
[Reactome](http://www.reactome.org/).\

Consortium's Download
