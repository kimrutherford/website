# How are sequence feature types defined in PomBase?
<!-- pombase_categories: Datasets,Genome Statistics and Lists,Sequence Retrieval -->

S. pombe genome features were originally annotated using
[Artemis](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/artemis/). As noted
in the manual
(ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/resources/software/artemis/artemis.pdf - see
p. 9), Artemis draws from a list of feature keys that is documented at
EBI: ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/embl/doc/FT\_current.html\#7.2\
\
In the genome sequence data files, features are defined using Sequence
Ontology terms. Gene pages use a selection of human-friendly
textÂ descriptions for feature types. (Further details will be available
here soon.)
