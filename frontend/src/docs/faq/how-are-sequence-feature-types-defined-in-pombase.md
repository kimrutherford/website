# How are sequence feature types defined in PomBase?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data,Genome statistics and lists -->

S. pombe genome features were originally annotated using
[Artemis](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/artemis). As noted
in the manual
(ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/resources/software/artemis/artemis.pdf - see
p. 9), Artemis draws from a list of feature keys that is documented at
EBI: ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/embl/doc/FT\_current.html\#7.2\

In the genome sequence data files, features are defined using
[Sequence Ontology](http://sequenceontology.org/) terms. Gene pages
use a selection of human-friendly text descriptions for feature types.
