# How can I retrieve the sequence of a region using sequence coordinates?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome Browser,Sequence Retrieval -->

Go to the Genome Browser (in the Tools menu), and find the region of
interest by searching for a gene name, a systematic ID, or a set of
coordinates. Then click the Export Data button on the left-hand side.

Select the number of bases up- and downstream (even if you have searched
using coordinates, you can add flanking sequence to what you download),
which strand and the features you would like. Click "next". Select your
download option. Your browser will save or display the data, depending
on which format you select.
