# How can I retrieve the sequence of a region using sequence coordinates?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome browser,Finding data -->

Go to the [Genome Browser](http://fungi.ensembl.org/Schizosaccharomyces_pombe/Info/Index) 
(or click the "View in Ensembl genome browser ..." link on any gene
page), and find the region of interest by searching for a gene name, a
systematic ID, or a set of coordinates. Then click the Export Data
button on the left-hand side.

Select the number of bases up- and downstream (even if you have searched
using coordinates, you can add flanking sequence to what you download),
which strand and the features you would like. Click "next". Select your
download option. Your browser will save or display the data, depending
on which format you select.
