# Is there a list of protein complexes in S. pombe, and their subunits?
<!-- pombase_categories: Datasets,Genome Statistics and Lists,Using Ontologies -->

Yes, there is a file that lists GO macromolecular complex assignments
for fission yeast gene products in the FTP directory:

<ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pombase/pombe/Complexes/>

Note that the complex inventory includes the RNA subunits of
ribonucleoprotein complexes. There is some redundancy in the list,
because some gene products are annotated to both complexes and
subcomplexes. For example, subunits of the DASH complex (GO:0042729) are
annotated to 'condensed chromosome outer kinetochore' (GO:0000940) as
well as GO:0042729. Additional notes are available in a README file:
<ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pombase/pombe/Complexes/README>
