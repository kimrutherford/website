# How many conserved unstudied proteins are there? How is the list generated?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome Statistics and Lists -->

As genes are annotated, each is assigned a status, as described on the
[Gene Characterisation](status/gene-characterisation)page. Taxonomic
conservation of a gene is assigned manually on a case-by-case basis,
taking into account multiple criteria. Additional information is
available from PomBase curators upon request.

Genes listed on the [Priority Unstudied Genes](status/priority-unstudied-genes)page are those that have
"conserved unknown" characterisation status and the "conserved in
vertebrates" taxonomic distribution.

You can also use the [Advanced Search](http://www.pombase.org/spombe/query/builder)to find conserved
unstudied genes as described in the FAQs on [characterisation status](/faq/what-does-characterisation-status-mean-gene)and [taxonomic conservation](/faq/can-i-search-genes-based-conservation-different-taxa).
Start by searching for Annotation Status "conserved unknown", and refine
the search by adding a Conserved in ... filter if you wish.
