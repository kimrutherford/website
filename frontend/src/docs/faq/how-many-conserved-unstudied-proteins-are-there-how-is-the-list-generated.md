# How many conserved unstudied proteins are there? How is the list generated?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome statistics and lists -->

As genes are annotated, each is assigned a status, as described on the
[Gene characterisation status](status/gene-characterisation) page. Taxonomic
conservation of a gene is assigned manually on a case-by-case basis,
taking into account multiple criteria. Additional information is
available from PomBase curators upon request.

Genes listed on the [Priority unstudied genes](status/priority-unstudied-genes) page are those that have
"conserved unknown" characterisation status and the "conserved in
vertebrates" taxonomic distribution.

You can also use the [advanced search](/query) to find conserved
unstudied genes as described in the FAQs on 
[characterisation status](/faq/what-does-the-characterisation-status-mean-for-a-gene) and 
[taxonomic conservation](/faq/can-i-search-for-genes-based-on-conservation-in-different-taxa).
Start by searching for Characterisation status "conserved unknown", and refine
the search by adding a Taxonomic conservation query if you wish.
