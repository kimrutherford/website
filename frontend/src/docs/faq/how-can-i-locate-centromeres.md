# How can I locate centromeres?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome browser,Finding data -->

Centromeres can be retrieved in the PomBase genome browser; the
coordinates are:

Chromosome I:
[3753687-3789421](https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/?loc=I%3A3753680..3789414&tracks=DNA%2CPomBase%20forward%20strand%20features%2CPomBase%20reverse%20strand%20features&highlight=)
Chromosome II:
[1602264-1644747](https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/?loc=II%3A1602261..1644744&tracks=DNA%2CPomBase%20forward%20strand%20features%2CPomBase%20reverse%20strand%20features&highlight=)
Chromosome III:
[1070904-1137003](https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/?loc=III%3A1070899..1136998&tracks=DNA%2CPomBase%20forward%20strand%20features%2CPomBase%20reverse%20strand%20features&highlight=)

Sequence features within the centromeres, such as repeats, are annotated
with Sequence Ontology terms. For more details, see the
[Centromeres](/status/centromeres) page.
