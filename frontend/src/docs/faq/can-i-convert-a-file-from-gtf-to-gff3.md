# Can I convert a file from GTF to GFF3?
<!-- pombase_categories: Tools and Resources -->

PomBase does not offer a converter. The Sequence Ontology site has a
conversion script that can be used via a web form (at
http://www.sequenceontology.org/cgi-bin/converter.cgi) or checked out
from their CVS repository.
