# Can I view variation data in PomBase?
<!-- pombase_categories: Datasets,Genome Browser -->

The genome browser includes variation data from natural *S.
pombe* isolates, published in:\
\
Jeffares DC *et al.* 2015. The genomic and phenotypic diversity of
Schizosaccharomyces pombe. *Nat Genet.* **47(3):**235-241. doi:
[10.1038/ng.3215](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.3215) 
[PMID:25665008](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25665008) \
\
To view the variation data, enable one or more of the tracks under
"Variation".
[Help](/faq/how-can-i-show-or-hide-tracks-genome-browser) is available
for enabling tracks.\
\
Insertions/deletions (indels) and SNPs can be enabled as separate
tracks, or "Sequence variants (all sources)" displays both types on a
single track. Clicking on any variation feature in the track brings up a
small pop-up box with a summary and link to further details about the
variation.\
\
A Variscan track showing variation diversity along the sequence is also
available.\
\
Ensembl provides a [quick reference card](http://test.genomebrowser.pombase.org/info/website/tutorials/Ensembl_variation_quick_reference_card.pdf) with
more information on the browser interface for variations.
