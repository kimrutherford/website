# Can I view variation data in PomBase?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data,Genome browser -->


The previous version of the PomBase genome browser included variation
data from natural *S.  pombe* isolates, published in:

Jeffares DC *et al.* 2015. The genomic and phenotypic diversity of
Schizosaccharomyces pombe. *Nat Genet.* **47(3):**235-241. doi:
[10.1038/ng.3215](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.3215) 
[PMID:25665008](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25665008) 

We will soon add these data to PomBase JBrowse.

To view the variation data, enable one or more of the tracks under
"Variation".
[Help](/faq/how-can-i-show-or-hide-tracks-genome-browser) is available
for enabling tracks.

Insertions/deletions (indels) and SNPs can be enabled as separate
tracks, or "Sequence variants (all sources)" displays both types on a
single track. Clicking on any variation feature in the track brings up a
small pop-up box with a summary and link to further details about the
variation.

A Variscan track showing variation diversity along the sequence is also
available.
