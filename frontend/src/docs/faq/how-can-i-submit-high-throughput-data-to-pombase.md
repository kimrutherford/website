# How can I submit high-throughput data to PomBase?
<!-- pombase_categories: Data submission and formats -->

PomBase welcomes large sets of published data. The recommended
submission route depends on the data type:

-   For any data that can be associated with genome sequence coordinates
    (e.g. gene expression, ChIP-seq protein localisation, variation,
    etc.), please use the [data submission form for HTP sequence-linked data](/submit-data/data-submission-form).
-   Several types of data associated with genes can be displayed on gene
    pages. PomBase has developed bulk upload formats for phenotype,
    modification, and gene expression data -- see the [FAQ on file formats](/faq/what-file-formats-can-i-use-to-submit-high-throughput-data) 
    for links to the file format descriptions and data submission forms.

If you have any other type of large-scale data -- or if you have
problems or questions regarding the available submission forms -- please
contact the [helpdesk](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org).
