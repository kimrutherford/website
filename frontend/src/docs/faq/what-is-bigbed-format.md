<!-- pombase_categories: Data Submission and Formats -->

BigBed is a binary file format that is created by conversion from
[BED](/faq/what-bed-format), and thus stores similar types of data for
display in a genome browser track.\
\
BigBedÂ format is described at the [UCSC Genome Bioinformatics web site](http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bigBed.html), and the
[Broad Institute file format guide](http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/bigbed) provides
