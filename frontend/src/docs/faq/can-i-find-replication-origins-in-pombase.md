# Can I find replication origins in PomBase?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data -->

Replication origins cannot yet be viewed or searched as features on
PomBase pages, but they can be displayed on tracks in the genome
browser. Select one or more of the tracks with data type "Replication
Origins" (see the
[browser track FAQ](/faq/how-can-i-show-or-hide-tracks-genome-browser) 
if necessary).

You can also use the data collated by Conrad Nieduszynski in
*S. pombe* OriDB:

-   Home page: <http://pombe.oridb.org/index.php>
-   Search:
    <http://pombe.oridb.org/search.php?chr=all&confirmed=true&likely=true&dubious=true&name=>
