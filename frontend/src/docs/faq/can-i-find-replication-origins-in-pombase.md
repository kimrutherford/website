# Can I find replication origins in PomBase?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data -->

Replication origin coordinates are not yet included in PomBase. We hope
to obtain comprehensive origin data in the genome browser in the future,
but we rely on user submissions to set priorities for adding data tracks
to the browser.

Until replication origins are available in PomBase, we suggest that you
use the data collated by Conrad Nieduszynski in *S. pombe* OriDB:
