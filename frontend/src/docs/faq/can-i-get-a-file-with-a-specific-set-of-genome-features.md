# Can I get a file with a specific set of genome features?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data,Tools and resources -->

The genomic GFF3 file available on the 
[Genome datasets](/downloads/genome-datasets) page includes all gene
features, but not LTRs or other repeats. The files in EMBL and GenBank
formats contain all annotated sequence features.

Another option for extracting all annotated features (or if you need
to specify which feature types to include) is to use the Ensembl
API. See the FAQ
"[Can I access PomBase via an API?](/faq/can-i-access-pombase-via-an-api)"
for more information on using the API.
