# Can I get a file with a specific set of genome features?
<!-- pombase_categories: Sequence Retrieval,Tools and Resources -->

The genomic GTF file available onÂ the [Genome
Datasets](/downloads/genome-datasets)page includes all gene features. We
plan to replace this with a GFF file in the future, and will add all
other annotated genome features (such as repeats) to the file at that
time.\
\
The EMBL format files also contain all annotated features.\
\
Another option for extracting all annotated features (or if you need to
specify which feature types to include) is to use the Ensembl API. See
the FAQ " [Can I access PomBase via an
API?](/faqs/can-i-access-pombase-api){.active}" for more information on
using the API.
