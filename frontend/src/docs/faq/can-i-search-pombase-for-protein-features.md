# Can I search PomBase for protein features?
<!-- pombase_categories: Querying/Searching,Using Ontologies -->

A selection of protein sequence motifs and features have been manually
curated using termsÂ  from the [Sequence
Ontology](http://sequenceontology.org/)(SO). For example,
[Rad54](/spombe/result/SPAC15A10.03c)has a KEN box (a motif recognized
by the anaphase-promoting complex; SO:0001807), and
[Cuf1](/spombe/result/SPAC31A2.11c)and
[Trz1](/spombe/result/SPAC1D4.10)have nuclear localization signals (NLS;
SO:0001528). These annotations are included in the Protein Features
section of the gene page.\
\
To search for these features, use one of the "Sequence Ontology" filters
in the [Advanced Search](/spombe/query/builder)(see the
[documentation](/documentation/advanced-search-documentation)for help
with searching).

Also see the FAQs on [transmembrane
domains](/faqs/how-can-i-find-proteins-have-transmembrane-domains)and
[protein
families](/faqs/how-can-i-find-all-s-pombe-proteins-particular-protein-family),
and the section of the search documentation on using Protein Filters.

Example query: [nuclear localization signal
(SO:0001528)](/spombe/query/builder?filter=37&value=%5B%7B%22param%22:%7B%22filter_1%22:%7B%22filter%22:%2229%22,%22query%22:%22SO:0001528%22%7D%7D,%22filter_count%22:%221%22%7D%5D)\
