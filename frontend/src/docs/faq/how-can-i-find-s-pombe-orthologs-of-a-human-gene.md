# How can I find *S. pombe* ortholog(s) of a human gene?
<!-- pombase_categories: Orthology,Finding data -->

In PomBase, human orthologs are curated for *S. pombe* genes as
described in the [Orthologs documentation](/documentation/orthologs).


To find *S. pombe* orthologs for a human gene, you can search for the
standard human gene name in the simple search box in the page
header. For example, searching for human *ABTB1* will retrieve the
*S. pombe* gene *btb3*. To find standard human gene names, you can
search [HGNC](http://www.genenames.org/). Note that in a few cases, a
human gene name will coincidentally match a name or synonym of a
non-orthologous *-S. pombe* gene as well as the actual curated
ortholog(s), so please check the gene pages carefully, especially if
your search retrieves more than one result.
