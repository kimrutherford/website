# How can I find S. pombe ortholog(s) of a human gene?
<!-- pombase_categories: Orthology,Querying/Searching -->

In PomBase, human orthologs are curated for *S. pombe* genes as
described in the [Manually Curated Orthologs documentation](/documentation/orthologs).

To find *S. pombe* orthologs for a human gene, you can search for the
standard human gene name in the Simple Search (go to
[http://www.pombase.org/search/ensembl](/search/ensembl) or use the
search box in the page header). For example, searching for human
*ABTB1* will retrieve the *S. pombe* gene *btb1*. To find standard human
gene names, you can search [HGNC](http://www.genenames.org/). Note that
in a few cases, a human gene name will coincidentally match a name or
synonym of a non-orthologous *S. pombe* gene as well as the actual
curated ortholog(s), so please check the gene pages carefully,
especially if your search retrieves more than one result.
