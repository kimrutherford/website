# How can I find all S. pombe genes that are conserved in human?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome Statistics and Lists,Orthology,Querying/Searching -->

Almost all genes that are conserved between fission yeast and human are
also conserved in other vertebrates (there are two exceptions, genes
encoding amino acid biosynthesis proteins that have become pseudogenes
in human). To retreive these genes, go to the Advanced Search
(http://www.pombase.org/spombe/query/builder), and choose the "Conserved
in ..." filter option. Then choose the description "Conserved in
vertebrates", and submit.
