# How can I find all *S. pombe* genes that are conserved in human?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data,Genome statistics and lists,Orthology -->

Almost all genes that are conserved between fission yeast and human
are also conserved in other vertebrates (there are two exceptions,
both of which are genes encoding amino acid biosynthesis proteins that
have become pseudogenes in human). To retreive these genes, go to the
[advanced search](query), click the "Taxonomic conservation" query
option, and choose the description "Conserved in vertebrates".
