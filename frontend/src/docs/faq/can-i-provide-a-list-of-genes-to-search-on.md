# Can I provide a list of genes to search on?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data -->


Yes, you can type or paste systematic IDs into the "Gene filter" query
in the [advanced search](/query). IDs can be separated by spaces,
commas, or newlines. Click "Lookup" to retrieve the results. At
present you can use the list in the query history to combine with
other queries, or download a fixed set of details (systematic ID, gene
name (if any), feature type, coordinates, and strand). We plan to
offer more flexible options in the near future, and to allow you to
upload a file with your gene list.
