# Can I provide a list of genes to search on?
<!-- pombase_categories: Querying/Searching -->

Yes. In the Advanced Search, the Gene Systematic IDs and Gene Names
filters both accept lists. You can type or paste lists of IDs/names into
the box, separated by commas or with one ID or name per line.\
\
At present, there is a fixed set of data retrieved when you execute the
search. We plan to offer more flexible options in the near future.
Later, we also hope to allow you to upload a file containing your gene
list.\
\
For convenience, there is a direct link to a search page pre-configured
to accept a list of systematic IDs available in the Find menu, on the
Find page, and here:

[http://www.pombase.org/spombe/query/builder?filter=12](/spombe/query/builder?filter=12)

Once you have done a search for your genes, the list of results will be
available in the Query Management section of the Advanced Search,
allowing you to combine the list with other lists or with additional
search criteria.
