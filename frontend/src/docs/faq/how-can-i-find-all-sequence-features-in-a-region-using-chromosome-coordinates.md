# How can I find all sequence features in a region using chromosome coordinates?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome browser,Finding data -->

You can do this in the [genome
browser](https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/) (or follow a link from a
gene page). First, [enter the coordinates](/faq/how-can-i-display-sequence-region-using-sequence-coordinates-genome-browser).

Ensure that the PomBase forward and reverse strand feature tracks are
visible (they are enabled by default). For each strand, click the
small triangle at the right-hand end of the track label to reveal the
popup menu. Select "Save track data", then choose from the options in
the popup.
