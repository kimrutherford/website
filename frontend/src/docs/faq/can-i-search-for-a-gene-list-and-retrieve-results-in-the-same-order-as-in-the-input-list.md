# Can I search for a gene list and retrieve results in the same order as in the input list?
<!-- pombase_categories: Querying/Searching -->

At present this is not possible; all advanced search results are ordered
alphabetically by systematic ID.

As a workaround, we suggest that you download the results using the TSV
link, and import them into a spreadsheet. You can then combine the
results with other data in the spreadsheet, and use the spreadsheet
software to sort on any column.
