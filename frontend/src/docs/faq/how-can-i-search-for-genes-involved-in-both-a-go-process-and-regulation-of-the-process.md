# How can I search for genes involved in both a GO process and regulation of the process?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data,Using ontologies -->

The [advanced search](/query) GO query retrieves gene products
annotated to a GO term and to any of its child terms, following the
*is_a*, *part_of*, and *regulates* relationships in the ontology (also
see the [PomBase GO documentation](/documentation/gene-page-gene-ontology). 
GO search results for Biological Process terms therefore include genes
involved in the process and its regulation.

Genes annotated directly to the process can be distinguished from
those annotated to regulation on the [ontology term page](/documentation/ontology-term-page) 
for the term.
