# How can I search for genes involved in both a GO process and regulation of the process?
<!-- pombase_categories: Querying/Searching,Using Ontologies -->

In the Advanced Search, you can search for two GO terms, one for the
process and another for regulation of the process, joined by the "OR"
operator. For example, to find genes involved in cytokinesis or its
regulation, search for "'cell cycle cytokinesis' (GO:0033205) OR
'regulation of cell cycle cytokinesis' (GO:0071775)".\
\
You can use "OR" in the Query Management interface. First search for
each term in a separate New Query, then click the Query Management tab.
Check the boxes beside the two queries you want to combine, and then
click the "Join (OR)" button to submit the compound query. The new query
will appear in the Query Management list itself, and you can do further
combinations with additional queries.
