# How can I obtain the list of human and S. pombe orthologs?
<!-- pombase_categories: Datasets,Genome Statistics and Lists,Orthology -->

The current version of the manually curated list of orthologs and
orthologous groups identified between fission yeast and human is
available for download from the [
[Orthologs](/downloads/manually-curated-orthologs)page (linked from the
[Datasets](/downloads/datasets)page)]{}.
