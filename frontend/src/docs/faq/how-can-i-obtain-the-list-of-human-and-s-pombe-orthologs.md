# How can I obtain the list of human and *S. pombe* orthologs?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data,Genome statistics and lists,Orthology -->

The current version of the manually curated list of orthologs and
orthologous groups identified between fission yeast and human is
available for download from the
[orthologs](ftp://ftp.pombase.org/pombe/orthologs/) FTP directory (linked from
the [Datasets](/downloads/datasets) page). Also see the FAQs on
[finding genes conserved in human](/faq/how-can-i-find-all-s.-pombe-genes-are-conserved-human),

and [finding the ortholog of a specific gene](/faq/how-can-i-find-s.-pombe-ortholog-s-human-gene).
