# How can I obtain the list of human and S. pombe orthologs?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data,Genome statistics and lists,Orthology -->

The current version of the manually curated list of orthologs and
orthologous groups identified between fission yeast and human is
available for download from the
[Orthologs](/downloads/manually-curated-orthologs) page (linked from
the [Datasets](/downloads/datasets) page). Also see the FAQs on
[finding genes conserved in human](/faq/how-can-i-find-all-s-pombe-genes-that-are-conserved-in-human),

and [finding the ortholog of a specific gene](/faq/how-can-i-find-s-pombe-orthologs-of-a-human-gene).
