# How can I obtain the list of human and S. pombe orthologs?
<!-- pombase_categories: Datasets,Genome Statistics and Lists,Orthology -->

The current version of the manually curated list of orthologs and
orthologous groups identified between fission yeast and human is
available for download from the [Orthologs](/downloads/manually-curated-orthologs) page (linked from the [Datasets](/downloads/datasets)  page).  Also see the FAQs on  [finding genes conserved in human](/faq/how-can-i-find-all-s-pombe-genes-are-conserved-human),
[finding disease gene orthologs](/faq/how-can-i-find-s-pombe-genes-associated-human-disease),
and [finding the ortholog of a specific gene](/faq/how-can-i-find-s-pombe-orthologs-human-gene).
