# How can I find genes in a region using chromosome coordinates?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data -->

<!-- 
* denotes things to confirm in actual interface when this works:
In the [advanced search](/query), click *"more queries" to see
the "Genes between coordinates" query option. Choose a chromosome from
the *pulldown, and enter start and end coordinates in the *text boxes.
-->

The [advanced search](/query) query to retrieve genes in a specified
genomic region is temporarily unavailable.

In the meantime, we suggest that you use the Genome Browser to find
all features (not only genes), [as described here](/faq/how-can-i-retrieve-sequence-region-using-sequence-coordinates).
