# Can I download the interaction data used by esyN?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data,Genome statistics and lists -->

The *S. pombe* networks in [esyN](http://www.esyn.org/) use the PomBase
[High Confidence Physical Interaction Network](/documentation/high-confidence-physical-interaction-network)
(HCPIN) data. The data can be downloaded in tab-delimited format from
the [Download Datasets](/downloads/datasets) page, which links to an
FTP directory with two files. One contains physical interaction data,
and the other contains GO substrate data. Each file lists two gene
systematic IDs and a reference identifier (usually a PubMed ID).
