# Can I download the interaction data used by esyN?
<!-- pombase_categories: Datasets,Genome Statistics and Lists -->

The *S. pombe*networks in [esyN](http://www.esyn.org/)use the PomBase
[High Confidence Physical Interaction
Network](/documentation/high-confidence-physical-interaction-network)(HCPIN)
data. The data can be downloaded in tab-delimited format from the
[Download Datasets](/downloads/datasets)page, which links to an FTP
directory with two files. One contains physical interaction data, and
the other contains GO substrate data. Each file lists two gene
systematic IDs and a reference identifier (usually a PubMed ID).
