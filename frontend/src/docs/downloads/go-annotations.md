### GO annotations

<div style="color: red">
**Warning:** Files in the old FTP site within the EBI domain are no
  longer updated. If you have a link that contains **ftp.ebi.ac.uk**,
  please check these pages for a link using
  **ftp.pombase.org**. Please [contact the PomBase
  curators](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org) if you need help finding a
  file or directory.
</div>

*S. pombe* GO annotations are available from the [PomBase FTP site](ftp://ftp.pombase.org/pombe/annotations/Gene_ontology/gene_association.pombase.gz)
or from the [GO repository](ftp://ftp.geneontology.org/pub/go/gene-associations/gene_association.pombase.gz)
(either link downloads a gzipped file). They include annotations
made by manual literature curation, annotations inferred from keyword
mappings based on curated descriptions, and annotations shared by the
UniProt [GOA](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) team. The file is tab-delimited
text, so it can be opened in a spreadsheet application or parsed with a
script; the [format](http://geneontology.org/page/go-annotation-file-gaf-format-21)
is described on the GO website.

Also see the [list of protein complexes](ftp://ftp.pombase.org/pombe/annotations/GO_complexes/) 
in the FTP directory, which uses GO macromolecular complex terms and
IDs.

Previous versions of the *S. pombe* GO annotation file can be retrieved
from the [PomBase FTP archive](ftp://ftp.pombase.org/pombe/annotations/Gene_ontology/OLD/)
or via the GO CVSweb interface
([PomBase](http://cvsweb.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/go/gene-associations/gene_association.pombase.gz)
files and the very old
[GeneDB](http://cvsweb.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/go/gene-associations/gene_association.GeneDB_Spombe.gz)
files are at separate locations on the GO site).
