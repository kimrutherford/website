[*S. pombe* GO
annotations](ftp://ftp.geneontology.org/pub/go/gene-associations/gene_association.pombase.gz)
(link downloads gzipped file from the GO repository) include annotations
made by manual literature curation, annotations inferred from keyword
mappings based on curated descriptions, and annotations shared by the
UniProt [GOA](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) team. The file is tab-delimited
text, so it can be opened in a spreadsheet application or parsed with a
script; the
[format](http://geneontology.org/page/go-annotation-file-gaf-format-20)
is described on the GO website.

Also see the list of protein complexes in the FTP directory
(<ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pombase/pombe/Complexes/>), which
uses GO macromolecular complex terms and IDs.

Previous versions of the *S. pombe* GO annotation file can be retrieved
from the [PomBase FTP
archive](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pombase/pombe/Gene_ontology/OLD/)
or via the GO CVSweb interface
([PomBase](http://cvsweb.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/go/gene-associations/gene_association.pombase.gz)
files and the very old
[GeneDB](http://cvsweb.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/go/gene-associations/gene_association.GeneDB_Spombe.gz)
files are at separate locations on the GO site).
