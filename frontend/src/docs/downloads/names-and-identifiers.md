**Gene Product to UniProt Accession Number**

-   [PomBase2UniProt.tsv](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pombase/pombe/Mappings/PomBase2UniProt.tsv)
    tab-delimited file of systematic identifier mapped to UniProt
    Accession Number

### All Gene Names

-   [allNames.tsv](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pombase/pombe/Mappings/allNames.tsv)
    tab-delimited file of systematic name, primary name (empty if not
    assigned), followed by all synonyms

### Systematic ID to Gene Product

Files include systematic name, primary name (empty if not assigned),
synonyms (empty if not assigned), followed by gene product description

-   [sysID2product.tsv](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pombase/pombe/Mappings/sysID2product.tsv) -
    protein-coding genes
-   [sysID2product.rna.tsv](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pombase/pombe/Mappings/sysID2product.rna.tsv) -
    non-coding RNA genes

Note: A tab-delimited file of systematic identifiers mapped to EC
numbers was previously maintained, but has not been updated since March
2012. The most recent version of the
[gp2EC.txt](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pombase/pombe/Mappings/OLD/gp2EC.txt)
file is available in the FTP archive, but because it is out of date it
may contain errors or omissions.
