## Fission yeast GO slim

The table below shows terms in the current fission yeast biological
process GO slim, and the number of annotations to each term. GO IDs
link to the QuickGO browser, where you can explore the ontology and
annotations further. Icons beside each GO term link to
[esyN](http://www.esyn.org/), which provides a graphical view of
interactions for the genes from the PomBase High Confidence Physical
Interaction Network (HCPIN) dataset. Only the subset of genes linked
into the interaction network will be displayed in the esyN network
view. The annotation totals link to pages with information about the
term and a list of annotated genes.

Further information is available from:

- [PomBase GO slim documentation](documentation/pombase-go-slim-documentation)
- [PomBase HCPIN documentation](documentation/high-confidence-physical-interaction-network)
- [esyN documentation](http://www.esyn.org/tutorial.html)
- [PomBase tips for using GO slim terms and annotations](browse-curation/fission-yeast-go-slimming-tips)
- [GO Slim Guide at the Gene Ontology website](http://geneontology.org/page/go-slim-and-subset-guide)

Note that both proteins and RNAs can be annotated to GO terms, and the
tables on this page include annotated RNAs. For some GO terms, notably
'cytoplasmic translation', RNAs make up a significant proportion of
the total annotated genes.
