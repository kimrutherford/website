## Gene name conflicts

List of gene names that have been used to refer to two (or more)
different genes. Resolution of these conflicts is under consideration by
the Gene Naming Committee. Upon conflict resolution, the name will
become a secondary name for at least one of the genes for which it has
been used (a database search will still retrieve all usages). Systematic
IDs, and primary names where available, for the conflictingly-named
genes are listed in columns 2 and 4.

These three kept temporarily to distinguish the three genomic copies. Current conventions need checking (Morimyo paper). (I haven't been able to identify which is which from this as base differences in the sequenced clones or the genome sequence mean they cannot be mapped unambiguously. Needs investigating; our B and C are identical.) SPAC23A1.10 has standard name tef102.|
