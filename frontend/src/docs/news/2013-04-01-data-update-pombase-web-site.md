### Data update on PomBase web site

We have once again updated the data available on the PomBase web site.
The data now includes manual curation through March 6, 2013.\
\
We now expect to be able to update PomBase data every month, and will
soon have an automated pipeline in place. We thank all of you for your
patience during the long months when updates were infrequent.\
\
You should also see a few small improvements in the site:

-   Ontology term pages now display the text definition for each term.
-   FASTA sequence retrieval should be quicker, and less likely to time
    out, for large gene lists.
-   There has been some tidying of the display of "extension" data for
    GO and phenotype annotations.

Last month we noted an intermittent problem with the "Reference" column
display in the data tables. The occurrence of this problem should now be
greatly reduced, so please let us know if you see it recurring.\
\
As usual, please don't hesitate to alert us of any other problems with
data or site performance, or if you have any questions.\
