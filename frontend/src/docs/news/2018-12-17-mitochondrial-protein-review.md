Responding to increasing interest in mitochondrial biology, especially
relating to ageing, neurogenerative diseases, and processes at the
ER-mitochondrion interface, we have reviewed *S. pombe* mitochondrial
GO annotations. Although there is still relatively little fission
yeast-derived experimental data in this area, we have refined many
inferred annotations for mitochondrial complexes and sub-components as
well as some for processes.

You can see all 753 *S. pombe* mitochondrial annotations on the
ontology term page for [mitochondrion (GO:0005739)](https://www.pombase.org/term/GO:0005739).
