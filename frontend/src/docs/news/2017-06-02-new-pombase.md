# New PomBase

A new version of the PomBase website is under development, and will be
released when it includes all features available in the current
version (and many new ones). You can follow its progress via
announcements on [pombelist](http://listserver.ebi.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/pombelist),
and try out the [preview](http://preview.pombase.org/) site.
