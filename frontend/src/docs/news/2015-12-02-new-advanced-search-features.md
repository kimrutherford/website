### New Advanced Search features

We have introduced new features to the [Advanced
Search](/spombe/query/builder):

-   There are now two query reuse options: store a query in your web
    browser cache, or download a JSON file that can be uploaded later to
    re-run.
-   You can now query for genes that interact genetically or physically
    with a specified gene.
-   The FYPO query now offers options to choose nulls (deletions or
    disruptions), wild-type overexpression, or all alleles. The search
    results will include any genes that have an allele that matches the
    allele criteria and the chosen phenotype.
