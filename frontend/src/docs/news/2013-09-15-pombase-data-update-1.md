### PomBase data update

We have once again updated the data available on the PomBase web site.
The data now includes manual curation through August 11, 2013. We are
particularly pleased to note that this update includes annotations from
several dozen papers curated by the *S. pombe* community. Many thanks to
all who have done, or are doing, paper curation in
[Canto](http://curation.pombase.org/pombe/).\
\
We also have an updated version of the *S. pombe*/human ortholog table
available upon [request](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org).
