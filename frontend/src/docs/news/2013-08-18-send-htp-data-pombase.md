### Send HTP data to PomBase

At the pombe 2013 meeting in London, PomBase staff received numerous
requests display various published data, such as gene expression,
histone modifications, etc. in the genome browser. To provide this, we
now invite pombe researchers to send data: If you have published any
high-throughput experiments that produced dataÂ  that can be associated
with genome sequence coordinates, and thereby displayed as tracks on the
PomBase genome browser, please fill out the [HTP Data Submission
Form](/submit-data/data-submission-form). We can also accept large sets
of phenotype data via the Phenotype Data Submission Form. If you have
any problems or questions, contact us via the [PomBase
Helpdesk](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org) at any time.
