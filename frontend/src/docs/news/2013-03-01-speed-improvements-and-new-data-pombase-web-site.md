### Speed improvements and new data on PomBase web site

We have updated the data available on the PomBase web site. The data now
includes manual curation through December 17, 2012, and reflects
complete curation of an additional 70 papers.\
\
We have also made some improvements "under the hood" that should make
gene page loading much faster. Please let us know if you have any
problems with gene pages loading slowly or incompletely, whether or not
you have reported issues in the past.\
\
We are aware that there is an intermittent problem with the "Reference"
column display in the data tables -- sometimes a PubMed ID appears
instead of an author name and year. This problem will be fixed as soon
as possible. Please alert us if you notice anything else odd or wrong.
