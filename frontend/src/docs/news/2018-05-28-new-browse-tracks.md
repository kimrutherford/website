### New genome browser tracks
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->

We are very pleased to announce that we have loaded a number of new datasets
into the PomBase [JBrowse genome browser](https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/).

These include:

   - [Thodberg *et al.* (2018)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/13/281642) - CAGE-defined
     <a href="https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/?loc=III%3A725762..736349&tracks=PomBase%20forward%20strand%20features%2CPomBase%20reverse%20strand%20features%2CTranscription%20start%20sites%20in%20YES%20(reverse%20strand)%20-%20Thodberg%20et%20al.%20(2018)%2CTranscription%20start%20sites%20in%20glucose%20minimal%20medium%20(forward%20strand)%20-%20Thodberg%20et%20al.%20(2018)%2CTranscription%20start%20sites%20in%20glucose%20minimal%20medium%20(reverse%20strand)%20-%20Thodberg%20et%20al.%20(2018)&highlight=~">transcription start sites</a> across 5 different conditions
   - [Yadav *et al.* (2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23163955) - <a href="https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/?loc=I%3A2364901..2436900&tracks=PomBase%20forward%20strand%20features%2CPomBase%20reverse%20strand%20features%2CPosition%20specific%20G(x)%20scores%20(free%20energy%20needed%20to%20separate%20a%20base%20pair)%20-%20Yadav%20et%20al.%20(2012)&highlight=">G(x) scores</a>
     specifying the amount of free energy needed to melt base pairs in the DNA
     duplex at different genomic locations
   - A PomBase-generated [dataset of promoter elements](https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/?loc=III%3A725762..736349&tracks=PomBase%20forward%20strand%20features%2CPomBase%20reverse%20strand%20features%2CConsensus%20transcription%20factor%20DNA%20binding%20motifs&highlight=) across the genome
     (computational matching of the [consensus promoter sequences](/browse-curation/dna-binding-sites) to the reference DNA sequence)
   - <a href="https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/?loc=I%3A2178501..2207300&tracks=PomBase%20forward%20strand%20features%2CPomBase%20reverse%20strand%20features%2CIntron%20Branch%20Points%20-%20Bitton%20et%20al.%20(2014)&highlight=">Intron branch points</a> from
     [Bitton *et al.* (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24709818)
     which was also available in the Ensembl browser.

For anyone wanting a quick introduction to our genome browser, Antonia
Lock has written ["Getting started with PomBase JBrowse"](/documentation/JBrowse_quick_start), 
a basic guide that covers loading tracks, navigating the browser,
what metadata we provide, and more.
