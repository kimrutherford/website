### New genome browser tracks
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->

We are very pleased to announce that we have loaded a number of new datasets
into the PomBase [JBrowse genome browser](https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/).

These include:

   - [Thodberg *et al.* (2018)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/13/281642) - CAGE-defined <a href="https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/?loc=II%3A2289649..2327609&tracks=PomBase%20forward%20strand%20features%2CDNA%20sequence%2CPomBase%20reverse%20strand%20features%2CIntron%20Branch%20Points%20-%20Bitton%20et%20al.%20(2014)%2Cnucleosome%20positioning%20during%20vegetative%20growth%20-%20Soriano%20et%20al.%20(2013)%2CPoly(A)%20sites%20during%20quiescence%2024h%20(forward%20strand)%20-%20Schlackow%20et%20al.%20(2013)%2CTranscription%20start%20sites%20in%20glucose%20minimal%20medium%20(forward%20strand)%20-%20Thodberg%20et%20al.%20(2018)%2CTotal%20transcripts%20during%20vegetative%20growth%20(repeat%201)%20-%20Marguerat%20et%20al.%20(2012)%2CTranscripts%20during%20meiosis%205h%20in%20pat1-114%20background%20(reverse%20strand)%20-%20Soriano%20et%20al.%20(2013)%2CSNPs%20in%20161%20S.%20pombe%20natural%20isolates%2CIndels%20in%20161%20S.%20pombe%20natural%20isolates%2CTranscription%20start%20sites%20in%20YES%20(reverse%20strand)%20-%20Thodberg%20et%20al.%20(2018)%2CTranscription%20start%20sites%20in%20YES%20(forward%20strand)%20-%20Thodberg%20et%20al.%20(2018)%2CTranscription%20start%20sites%20during%20oxidative%20stress%20(forward%20strand)%20-%20Thodberg%20et%20al.%20(2018)%2CConsensus%20transcription%20start%20sites%20-%20Thodberg%20et%20al.%20(2018)%2CTranscription%20start%20sites%20during%20heat%20shock%20(reverse%20strand)%20-%20Thodberg%20et%20al.%20(2018)%2CTranscription%20start%20sites%20during%20nitrogen%20starvation%20(forward%20strand)%20-%20Thodberg%20et%20al.%20(2018)%2CTranscription%20start%20sites%20during%20nitrogen%20starvation%20(reverse%20strand)%20-%20Thodberg%20et%20al.%20(2018)%2CTranscription%20start%20sites%20during%20heat%20shock%20(forward%20strand)%20-%20Thodberg%20et%20al.%20(2018)%2CTranscription%20start%20sites%20during%20oxidative%20stress%20(reverse%20strand)%20-%20Thodberg%20et%20al.%20(2018)%2CTranscription%20start%20sites%20in%20glucose%20minimal%20medium%20(reverse%20strand)%20-%20Thodberg%20et%20al.%20(2018)&highlight=">transcription start sites</a> across 5 different conditions

     [Bitton *et al.* (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24709818)
     which was also available in the Ensembl browser.

For anyone wanting a quick introduction to our genome browser, Antonia
Lock has written ["Getting started with PomBase JBrowse"](/documentation/JBrowse_quick_start), 
a basic guide that covers loading tracks, navigating the browser,
what metadata we provide, and more.
