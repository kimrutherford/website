### New genome browser tracks
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: new_tracks.png -->

We are very pleased to announce that we have loaded a number of new datasets into the PomBase [JBrowse genome browser (https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/). These include:

   - [Thodberg *et al.* (2018)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/13/281642) - CAGE-defined
     [transcription start sites][tss] across 5 different conditions
   - [Yadav *et al.* (2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23163955) - [G(x) scores][gx]
     specifying the amount of free energy needed to melt base pairs in the DNA
     duplex at different genomic locations
   - A PomBase-generated [dataset of promoter elements][prom] across the genome
     (computational matching of the [consensus promoter sequences](/browse-curation/dna-binding-sites) to the reference DNA sequence)
   - [Intron branch points][intron] from
     [Bitton *et al.* (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24709818)
     which was also available in the Ensembl browser.

For anyone wanting a quick introduction to our genome browser, Antonia Lock has written ["Getting started with PomBase JBrowse"](/documentation/JBrowse_quick_start), a basic guide that covers loading tracks, navigating the browser, what metadata we provide, and more.
