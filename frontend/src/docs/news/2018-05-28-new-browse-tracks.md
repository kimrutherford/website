### New genome browser tracks
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->

We are very pleased to announce that we have loaded a number of new datasets
into the PomBase [JBrowse genome browser](https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/).

These include:

   - [Thodberg *et al.* (2018)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/13/281642) - CAGE-defined
     Transcription Start Sites across 5 different conditions
   - [Yadav *et al.* (2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23163955) - G(x) scores
     specifying the amount of free energy needed to melt base pairs in the DNA
     duplex at different genomic locations
   - A PomBase-generated dataset of [promoter elements across the genome](/browse-curation/dna-binding-sites)
     (computational matching of the consensus promoter sequences to the reference DNA sequence)
   - The intron branch points from
     [Bitton *et al.* (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24709818)
     which was also available in the Ensembl browser.

For anyone wanting a quick introduction to our genome browser, Antonia
Lock has written ["Getting started with PomBase JBrowse"](/documentation/JBrowse_quick_start), 
a basic guide that covers loading tracks, navigating the browser,
what metadata we provide, and more.
