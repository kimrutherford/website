The publication describing the reimplementation of PomBase is [now available](https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gky961/5128936) from NAR. We have updated the [Citing PomBase](about/citing-pombase) to recommend citing this new paper. Thank you all for guiding the development of the new, improved PomBase, and for your continued usage, curation contributions, and suggestions!
