### Human ortholog data correction coming next month

We are about to release a data update for PomBase. Please note that
there is still a problem with the human orthologs, as originally
described on this list in mid-December (see archived message at
<http://listserver.ebi.ac.uk/pipermail/pombelist/2013/003926.html>). We
will correct this problem in the next PomBase release, and apologise for
any inconvenience in the meantime.
