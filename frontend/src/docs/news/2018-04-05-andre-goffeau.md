### In memory of Andr&eacute; Goffeau
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->

Sadly, PomBase staff and the fission yeast community note the death of Andr&eacute; Goffeau on April 2, 2018. In addition to initiating and coordinating the sequencing of the budding yeast genome, Prof. Goffeau will be remembered for his contributions to the fission yeast genome project and for his knowledge, leadership, and friendship.
