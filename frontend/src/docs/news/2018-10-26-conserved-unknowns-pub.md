### Hidden in plain sight: What remains to be discovered in the eukaryotic proteome?
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->

In a new publication, PomBase curators consider the challenges and opportunities that conserved, but persistently unstudied, proteins pose for diverse areas of basic and applied biology. To draw attention to these proteins, we develop metrics to define unknown lists, provide unknown inventories for human and yeast, classify *S. pombe* unknowns by numerous orthogonal attributes, and speculate about reasons for their neglect.

A [pre-publication manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/16/469569) is available at bioRxiv.
