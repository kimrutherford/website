### Canto downtime & new version

Canto, PomBase's literature curation tool, will be unavailable for
approximately 3 weeks starting at 12:00 midnight UK time (BST) tonight,
27 May 2015, while we deploy an upgraded version.\
\
The upgraded Canto will feature an entirely new interface for annotating
multi-allele phenotypes and the corresponding genotypes, as well as
improved workflows for single-allele phenotypes, GO, etc. All existing
annotations will be retained, and users can resume curation using the
new and improved features in any unfinished sessions when Canto is back
online.\
\
We will announce when the new version of Canto is released to the
public.
