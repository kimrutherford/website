# About PomBase

PomBase is a new model organism database that provides organization of
and access to scientific data for the fission yeast
Schizosaccharomyces pombe. PomBase supports genomic sequence and
features, genome-wide datasets and manual literature curation.

PomBase also provides a community hub for researchers, providing
genome statistics, a community curation interface, news, events,
documentation and mailing lists.
