<p>We are very pleased to announce that we have loaded a number of new datasets into the PomBase <a routerLink="/jbrowse/">JBrowse genome browser</a>.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/13/281642">Thodberg <em>et al.</em> (2018)</a> - CAGE-defined Transcription Start Sites across 5 different conditions</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23163955">Yadav <em>et al.</em> (2012)</a> - G(x) scores specifying the amount of free energy needed to melt base pairs in the DNA duplex at different genomic locations</li>
<li>A PomBase-generated dataset of <a routerLink="/browse-curation/dna-binding-sites">promoter elements across the genome</a> (computational matching of the consensus promoter sequences to the reference DNA sequence)</li>
<li>The intron branch points from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24709818">Bitton <em>et al.</em> (2014)</a> which was also available in the Ensembl browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>For anyone wanting a quick introduction to our genome browser, Antonia Lock has written <a routerLink="/documentation/JBrowse_quick_start">&quot;Getting started with PomBase JBrowse&quot;</a>, a basic guide that covers loading tracks, navigating the browser, what metadata we provide, and more.</p>

<h5 id="new-book-chapter-about-pombase-2018-05-22"><strong>New book chapter about PomBase <em>2018-05-22</em> </strong></h5>
<p>PomBase has a <a href="https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-7737-6_4">new book chapter</a> in <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-7737-6"><em>Eukaryotic Genomic Databases</em> (Methods and Protocols)</a>.</p>
<p>This chapter provides insight into the curation philosophy and data organization at PomBase, and provides a guide to using PomBase tailored for infrequent visitors and anyone considering extending their research to include <em>S. pombe</em>.</p>
<p>The chapter is <a href="https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-7737-6_4">free to download</a> courtesy of the <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</a>.</p>

<h5 id="pombase-releases-jbrowse-2018-04-16"><strong>PomBase releases JBrowse <em>2018-04-16</em> </strong></h5>
<p>PomBase has now implemented <a href="https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/?loc=II%3A564641..602220&amp;tracks=DNA%2CPomBase%20forward%20strand%20features%2CPomBase%20%20reverse%20strand%20features&amp;highlight=">JBrowse</a>, from the <a href="http://gmod.org/wiki/Main_Page">GMOD</a> project, as its genome browser. The new browser offers a number of improvements over the old:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick, responsive scrolling and zooming</li>
<li>Simple track selection interface</li>
<li>Intuitive controls</li>
<li>Simplified data submission pipeline behind the scenes</li>
<li>More informative track metadata</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="in-memory-of-andré-goffeau-2018-04-05"><strong>In memory of André Goffeau <em>2018-04-05</em> </strong></h5>
<p>Sadly, PomBase staff and the fission yeast community note the death of André Goffeau on April 2, 2018. In addition to initiating and coordinating the sequencing of the budding yeast genome, Prof. Goffeau will be remembered for his contributions to the fission yeast genome project and for his knowledge, leadership, and friendship.</p>
