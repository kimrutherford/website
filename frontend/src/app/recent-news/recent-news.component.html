<h4 id="new-nucleosome-occupancy-maps-loaded"><strong>New nucleosome occupancy maps loaded</strong></h4>
<p><em>2018-12-03</em></p>
<p>We have loaded the nucleosome occupancy maps as described in González et al. (2016) <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27662899">PMID: 27662899</a>. This dataset was generated using the paired-end sequencing protocol of Illumina and thus those maps are of higher resolution than those made with single-end (SE) sequencing hosted in the browser since before.</p>
<p>Here is a link that <a href="https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/?loc=II%3A2751621..2767510&tracks=PomBase%20forward%20strand%20features%2CPomBase%20reverse%20strand%20features%2Cnucleosome%20positioning%20during%20vegetative%20growth%3B%20repeat%201%20-%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20et%20al.%20%282016%29%2Cnucleosome%20positioning%20during%20vegetative%20growth%3B%20repeat%202%20-%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20et%20al.%20%282016%29%2CDNA%20sequence&highlight=">loads the tracks in PomBase JBrowse</a>.

<p>Many thanks to Paco Antequera for sending us the bigwig files! If you would like us to load any datasets then please get in touch.</p>

<h4 id="see-your-genes-in-a-quilt"><strong>See your genes in a QuiLT</strong></h4>
<p><em>2018-11-21</em></p>
<p>PomBase now offers a new way to display gene lists graphically based on multiple orthogonal annotation types — the Quick Little Tool (QuiLT) for visualisation.</p>
<p>Inspired by our recent analysis of conserved unstudied proteins (see figures 4 and S1 in the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/16/469569">manuscript at bioRxiv</a>), QuiLT allows you to create a similar figure for any gene list you create or import using the advanced search. To use QuiLT, follow the link to your search results, then click the &quot;Visualise&quot; button. QuiLT visualisation is also available from the PomBase pages that list genes annotated to an ontology term, and on the Priority unstudied genes page.</p>
<p>The QuiLT display is interactive, and you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlight subsets of the list, and filter the display</li>
<li>Toggle annotation types on and off</li>
<li>Reorder the list to focus on features of most interest</li>
<li>Download the image</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a routerLink="/documentation/quick-little-tool">QuiLT documentation</a> for more information, and <a href="mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org">contact the curators</a> if you have comments, questions or suggestions.</p>
<p>Many thanks to our star (and only) programmer, Kim Rutherford, for developing QuiLT.</p>

<p><em>2018-11-20</em></p>
<p>The Gene Ontology &quot;<a href="https://www.pombase.org/term_genes/GO:0055085">transmembrane transport</a>&quot; branch has recently been substantially revised. In line with these revisions, PomBase has standardised gene product descriptions for transporters, and overhauled GO annotations to be as complete and comprehensive as possible based on current knowledge.</p>

<p><em>2018-11-17</em></p>
<p>In a new publication, PomBase curators consider the challenges and opportunities that conserved, but persistently unstudied, proteins pose for diverse areas of basic and applied biology. To draw attention to these proteins, we develop metrics to define unknown lists, provide unknown inventories for human and yeast, classify <em>S. pombe</em> unknowns by numerous orthogonal attributes, and speculate about reasons for their neglect.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/16/469569">pre-publication manuscript</a> is available at bioRxiv.</p>

<p>Our usage statistics informed us that over 20% of devices accessing PomBase are smartphones or tablets. We therefore spent some time optimizing the display for small screens. We hope that you will continue to enjoy PomBase on the go!</p>

<p>PomBase curators are major contributors to the <a href="http://geneontology.org/">Gene Ontology</a> (GO) project — ontology content, annotations, and QC procedures — and co-authors on the new <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky1055">GO NAR Database Issue paper</a>.</p>
<p>We recommend citing the GO and PomBase NAR papers when you use GO data in your analyses.</p>

<p>RNAcentral is a comprehensive database of non-coding RNA sequences. PomBase is an RNAcentral Consortium member, and all of the curated non-coding RNAs from PomBase will be available in RNAcentral soon. For more information, see their recent <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky1034">NAR Database Issue paper</a>, as well as current <a href="https://rnacentral.org/search?q=pombe">search results for <em>S. pombe</em> RNAs</a>.</p>
