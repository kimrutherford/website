<p>We have updated the data available on the PomBase web site to include manual curation through September 11, 2016.</p>

<h4 id="show-your-support-for-database-funding">Show your support for database funding</h4>
<p>In response to planned cuts to database funding, leading model organism researchers have prepared an open letter to NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins to demonstrate support for the independent community-focused databases that are essential to their work. Although PomBase is not directly funded by NIH, we collaborate extensively with those that are, including the GO Consortium and several model organism databases.<br />
<br />
The Genetics Society of America website where the letter can be viewed and signed is at <a href="http://www.genetics-gsa.org/MODsupport" class="uri">http://www.genetics-gsa.org/MODsupport</a><br />
<br />
Please sign the letter to add your voice in support of the databases that help make your research possible. For more information, we recommend an email that Mike Cherry sent to the GO-Friends mailing list, archived at <a href="https://mailman.stanford.edu/pipermail/go-friends/2016-June/002355.html" class="uri">https://mailman.stanford.edu/pipermail/go-friends/2016-June/002355.html</a></p>
