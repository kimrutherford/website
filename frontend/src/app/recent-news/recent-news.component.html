<p><em>2018-11-17</em></p>
<p>In a new publication, PomBase curators consider the challenges and opportunities that conserved, but persistently unstudied, proteins pose for diverse areas of basic and applied biology. To draw attention to these proteins, we develop metrics to define unknown lists, provide unknown inventories for human and yeast, classify <em>S. pombe</em> unknowns by numerous orthogonal attributes, and speculate about reasons for their neglect.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/16/469569">pre-publication manuscript</a> is available at bioRxiv.</p>

<p>Our usage statistics informed us that over 20% of devices accessing PomBase are smartphones or tablets. We therefore spent some time optimizing the display for small screens. We hope that you will continue to enjoy PomBase on the go!</p>

<p><em>2018-10-23</em></p>
<p>PomBase gene pages now use interactive graphics from PomBase JBrowse to depict the genomic region around the gene. Drag to scroll left and right, double-click to zoom in, shift-double-click to zoom out, and click a feature to see details in a popup. The &quot;Full-screen view&quot; link in the corner opens the fully functional JBrowse in a new tab or window. Reloading a gene page restores the display to the default location and zoom level.</p>

<h4 id="fungal-pathogen-genomics-course-2019---registration-open"><strong>Fungal Pathogen Genomics Course 2019 - registration open</strong></h4>
<p><em>2018-10-10</em></p>
<p>Registration for the <a href="https://coursesandconferences.wellcomegenomecampus.org/our-events/fungal-pathogen-genomics-2019/">2019 Fungal Pathogen Genomics Course</a> is now open. The course is hosted by Wellcome Genome Advanced Courses and Scientific Conferences, and will take place May 7-12, 2019, at the Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, UK. Course content provides hands-on training on how to: - Take advantage of unique tools offered by FungiDB, EnsemblFungi, PomBase, SGD/CGD, and MycoCosm/JGI; - Develop testable hypotheses; - Investigate transcriptomics, proteomics and genomics datasets across multiple databases and different user interfaces. Please see the <a href="https://coursesandconferences.wellcomegenomecampus.org/our-events/fungal-pathogen-genomics-2019/">course website</a> for more information, including how to apply, costs (limited bursaries are available), programme, and logistics.</p>
