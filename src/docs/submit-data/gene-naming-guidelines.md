## Fission yeast gene naming guidelines

### Purpose of Reserving Gene Names

To avoid gene naming conflicts, the
*S. pombe*[Gene Naming Committee](submit-data/gene-naming-committee-members)
accepts reservations for gene names that will be published
imminently. This does not guarantee that no one else will use your
reserved gene name, but the naming committee will actively discourage
alternative usage. If we become aware of a nomenclature conflict, we
will attempt to notify all parties.

### Guidelines for naming *S. pombe* genes

1.  The gene name should consist of three italicized lower case letters
    (the gene symbol) followed by an integer (e.g. rad26). This
    will not be italicized in the database. (Note that a few historical
    gene names with four letters, or without an integer, have been
    grandfathered into the database, but all new standard gene names
    must conform to the three-letters-plus-integer pattern.)
2.  The gene name registration form will return soon. To reserve a
    gene name in the meantime, please [email the helpdesk](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org?subject=gene name
    reservation) and include the gene systematic ID, proposed gene
    name, name description, the relevant PubMed ID (if available), and
    any other information.
3.  The 3-letter gene symbol should stand for a description of a
    phenotype, gene product or gene function. In addition, we strongly
    prefer that a given gene symbol have only one associated
    description, i.e., all genes which use a given 3 letter symbol
    should have a related phenotype, gene product or gene function. If a
    3-letter symbol is already in use, it should not be used to describe
    a different class of genes. Before choosing your gene name, search
    ${database_name} for any gene name beginning with the
    3-letter symbol, by entering the 3-letter name followed by an
    asterisk, e.g. "cdc\*". Also check the usage of the 3-letter
    code in *S. cerevisiae* at [SGD](http://www.yeastgenome.org/).
4.  Please include your gene name(s) in the abstracts of any relevant
    papers. This simplifies the task of identifying yeast gene names
    that are already in use.
5.  At the time of registration, the *S. pombe* curator will check
    PubMed, GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ and the Gene Name Registry to ensure the
    gene name is unique. If your chosen gene name is not unique, you
    will be contacted and asked to select a new name.
6.  Please check that the reserved gene name is still unique, and that
    the gene still has no other name used for it, before submitting a
    publication.
7.  If it is discovered that your gene has been previously named, your
    gene name would instead become an alias (synonym) for the locus, and
    it and any associated references will remain searchable and linked
    to the standard locus name.
8.  If you reserve a gene name prior to publication, and your reserved
    name is published referring to a different gene before your name
    usage is published, a compromise specific to the situation will be
    made. In most cases, you will NOT retain the use of the gene name
    unless you published the name first (see "Resolution of gene name
    conflicts" below).
9.  If no conflicts arise, your gene name will become the standard
    name, and will appear on the gene page and elsewhere in ${database_name}.

2.  Gene names may be reserved using the [Gene Name Registration
    Form](submit-data/gene-registration-form). Please provide requested information and
    an explanation of the 3-letter gene symbol.

<!-- probably won't retain this

### Renewing a reserved gene name

To renew a gene name reservation, you must submit new data demonstrating
continued study of this gene. Please use the [Gene Name Registration
Form](registration-form) to submit a renewal.

### Resolution of gene name conflicts

Gene name conflicts in which multiple names have been used to describe
one gene or, conversely, one name has been applied to multiple genes,
will be resolved within 12 months. Whenever possible, all interested
parties will be involved in the resolution of the conflict. We recognize
that each case is unique, and we will choose the most appropriate
solution using the following guidelines:

1.  **Researcher consensus:** In the first instance, if the researchers
    involved in the name conflict agree to a resolution that satisfies
    our Gene Naming requirements, this solution will be implemented.
2.  **Literature consensus:** In the absence of researcher consensus, we
    will examine the literature for the number of name usages and the
    number of different research groups utilizing a particular name
    usage. If there is a very obvious imbalance, we will favour the
    predominant name usage.
3.  **Priority:** In the absence of either researcher or literature
    consensus, we will favour the gene name usage that was first
    published if this is significantly earlier. However, if papers are
    published simultaneously (within 3 months), the pre-registered name
    will become the primary name.
4.  **Relevance of the name:** In rare cases where none of the above
    guidelines apply, we may favour a particular name usage that
    more accurately describes a phenotype, gene product or gene
    function.
