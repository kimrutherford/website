## New, improved PomBase

The new PomBase web site was released on October 24, 2017.

The new site uses streamlined back-end data storage and retrieval
procedures that support nightly data updates and a host of other
improvements:

 - New publication pages: For each publication loaded into PomBase, a
   page summarizes essential details about paper, and shows any
   annotations that cite it.\
   [Example page (PMID:27984725)](/reference/PMID:27984725) and [Documentation](/documentation/publication-page)
 - New genotype pages: Genotype pages are analogous to gene pages, but
   describe the alleles that make up a genotype, and show phenotypes
   associated with the genotype.\
   [Example page (cdc25-22)](/genotype/e5a15cdcd4aa21c4-genotype-6) and [Documentation](/documentation/genotype-page)
 - Improved ontology term pages: Each ontology term page now includes
   annotation details for annotated genes (or genotypes, for FYPO),
   with summary and detailed views. The detailed views show descendant
   terms with ontology relations, and distinguish annotations to more
   or less specific terms.\
   [Example page (GO:0000070)](/term/GO:0000070) and [Documentation](/documentation/ontology-term-page)
 - Improved summary views for annotation displays: On gene, genotype,
   term, and publication pages, the summary view is now
   non-redundant. See the gene page [documentation](/documentation),
   example pages above, and an [example gene page (wee1)](/gene/SPCC18B5.03)
   for more information.
 - Phenotype annotation display filtering: The FYPO display on gene,
   genotype, and publication can be filtered to show annotation
   subsets based on broad phenotypic categories. See the gene page
   [pheontype documentation](/documentation/gene-page-phenotypes) and
   the example pages above for more information.
 - Faster querying in the [advanced search](/query)
 - Front page research and community curation highlights
