## PomBase Scientific Advisory Board

The PomBase Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) will provide strategic
scientific advice to the PomBase team covering current and future
priorities related to curation, tools provided and outreach. They will
advise how can we better align *S. pombe* knowledge to human genetics
and health. The SAB is an independent body, made up of leading experts
in both fission yeast biology and Model Organism Databases from around
the world.
