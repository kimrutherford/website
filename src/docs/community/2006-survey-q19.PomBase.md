<p><strong>Please provide any additional comments and information about the current resource which you feel were not covered by this survey</strong></p>

<li>I often use published literatures of my interesting genes. I sometimes found that some literatures was not related to the gene I was interested in. One thing I noticed was that the same name was shown in those papers. Gene expression profiles are very usful. If possible, I would like to see the links of other eukaryotic orthologues not just only S. cerevisiae orthologues.</li>
<li>Genedb is a great resource. It is amazing that such a fantastic resource has been built so quickly with such limited funding. I hope that it can be extended as it provides a very valuable resource for the community.</li>
<li>the access to the site and downloading information is very slow at times.</li>
<li>It is an excellent resource.</li>
<li>I cannot understand what some of the items or screens are that you refer to in question 4? What is a context map? Some of the others required me to guess, even after looking at web page to answer this survey. I suggest approaching the answers to this question with caution. As a budding yeast researcher, SGD has been a godsend for our speed of work. The closer you get to this level of functionality, the better S. pombe will be as an experimental system.</li>
<li>Val and the people who work on the database are very helpful in terms of answering questions and helping with specific problems.</li>
<li>form stonger ties/links with SGD and other yeast databases</li>
<li>Most up-to-date information in pombe community</li>
<li>Set the default sequence download range to span only the gene ORF, with options to extend up or downstream.</li>
<li>great resource - thanks v much!</li>
<li>NA</li>
<li>Not all the data published is curated.</li>
<li>It would be useful to suggest promoter region, if possible. This is necessary when we plan to clone the genomic version of the gene for expression study.</li>
<li>Thank you</li>
<li>I think it is a wonderful source...Long Live GeneDB!!!</li>
<li>This is an essential service which must be maintained to the highest standard.</li>
<li>qq</li>
<li>This is an absolutely essential resource for our community. Valerie Wood had done a truly remarkable job so far. She is proactive in seeking input from the community and she is also very responsive to our needs and suggestions. It is clear that she cares that this database and resource should be of the highest quality, though I cannot imagine how she accomplishes all that she does. It seems to me that this project must require many many qualified people. I don&#39;t know how many additional people are involved. Valerie Wood has always been the person to respond to us when we have requested information or guidance.</li>
<li>This is a fantastic resource for teh fission yeast community and should be maintained and continually improved.</li>
<li>It seems to me the most valuable tool to include in this database is a comprehensive collection of annotations with references to the literature. This will require continous updating.</li>
<li>S. pombe GeneDB does not appear to have the gene sequence for the mating type plus information (mat2 sequence for h+), is this because the genome sequence was from a h- strain? I think that the plus genes should be added.</li>
<li>none</li>
<li>important resource !</li>
<li>The data base is wonderful. We all appreciate the administration very much.</li>
<li>none</li>
<li>I found it very well organized</li>
<li>No comments</li>
<li>no</li>
<li>- very important resource, like the new YOGY a lot. - need easier community annotation, literature linking (e.g. for specific genes mentioned in own papers, authors could link them to YOGY resource directly, rather than waiting for the indexing services to put it there as a general reference only).</li>
<li>In general DNA regulatory elements are very badely annoted in the pombe data base. For example, whereas the mating locus organisation is very well known, it still very difficult to find in the pombe genome data base (using artemis)where mat1, 2 and 3 are exactely located.</li>
<li>genetic interactions physical interactions</li>
<li>The Fission Yeast database is an ESSENTIAL part of the bioinformatic framework of S.pombe genome analysis.</li>
<li>--</li>
<li>GeneDB is a minimal resource which is essential for modern fission yeast research. Even so many things are missing and need to be built out.</li>
<li>its fine</li>
<li>I&#39;m just starting this postdoc in pombe. I have recently joined pombelist (1 month), and so I cannot comment about many of the services. In general, I have found it to be useful although my use of it has been limited. Perhaps its greatest utility is by linking the pombe community? I anticipate using the database a great deal in the coming months, and I will be happy to report back in the future on my experiences.</li>
<li>Another point for the wish list: genetic and physical intaractions would be very helpfull too...</li>
<li>none</li>
<li>please provide web services</li>
<li>The current resource does not have logical species coverage. It just covers what the Pathogens Sequencing Unit have been working on. An S. pombe-based resource would be more relevant and even more useful than the current resource, and is essential for smooth rational progress of research with this important model organism.</li>
<li>Val Wood does an outstanding job keeping the database updated and informing the Pombe community about changes to GeneDB. Her hard work has made this database an invaluable resource for the fission yeast research community.</li>
<li>Protein localisation</li>
<li>So far GeneDB is supurb. Sometimes I find pombe GeneDB is better than budding yeast equivalent. I hope that the Sanger Centre continues to make effort to impove this important resource. It is essential for our research and community.</li>
<li>This has really become an essential resource for S. pombe research even for an occaisional user like myself.</li>
<li>Since we use S. cerevisiae as our primary research organism, I am a frequent visitor to the SGD homepage. I would benefit a lot if the primary pombe and cerevisiae pages would have a similar structure/navigation and have similar features.</li>
<li>No Thanks</li>
<li>Maybe I missed it but I would appreciate a possibility to download GO terms (including parents) using the ListDownload feature.</li>
<li>Keep up the good work!</li>
<li>I think joining up with Saccharomyces would be a good idea.</li>
<li>Thanks for all the work you do in bringing fission yeast up to the level of &quot;model organism&quot;. Keep up the good work!</li>
<li>Please note that the genomes of all four yeasts mentioned have been sequences and that inclusion of these yeasts would be extremely helpful for cross-species analyses.</li>
<li>aim for database to facilitate/increase the usefulness of pombe as a model organism -for human disease, for conserved genes and gene families</li>
<li>The people associated with this are exceptional. In particular Val Wood is quick to respond to questions and comments and has provided us with considerable support and information. She is acknowledged in both of our 2006 papers for significant intellectual contributions.</li>
<li>The GeneDB is an absolutely inevitable knowledge resource for the pombe researchers.</li>
<li>very valuable resource and essential for the pombe community</li>
<li>The GeneDB front end works very well.</li>
<li>It is absolutely essential to secure funding for this !!!!</li>
