# The Fission Yeast Community Curation Project

Comprehensive manual curation of the *S. pombe* literature is a primary
goal of the PomBase project, and among the most important activities
of the curation staff. Increasing numbers of new publications, and a
large backlog of older papers, however, mean that complete literature
curation will require input from the research community as well as the
efforts of dedicated professional curators.

The PomBase Community Curation system enables researchers to
contribute annotations directly to PomBase based on their publications
using Canto, a web-based tool that allows both curators and
researchers to create annotations. Canto supports GO, phenotype,
interaction, and modification annotations, and can be configured for
use with other ontologies as the need arises. Annotations made in the
community curation system will be prioritized for inclusion in PomBase
and will therefore also be more rapidly disseminated to other
databases (e.g. GenBank/ENA/DDBJ, UniProtKB, BioGRID and GO), making
data from annotated papers widely visible.

**How to contribute**: For newly published papers, PomBase curators
  email authors inviting them to participate, with specific
  instructions and links. Lab members are also welcome to evaluate
  existing annotations and create new annotations from past
  publications â€” use the PubMed ID search on the
  [main PomBase Canto page](https://curation.pombase.org/pombe). Anyone
  can also try the
  [demo version of Canto](https://curation.pombase.org/demo).

**Progress and attribution**:
  [Curation statistics](https://curation.pombase.org/pombe/stats/annotation)
  track S. pombe papers curated in Canto by PomBase and community
  curators, and the annotations obtained. Canto will soon allow
  contributors to register [ORCID](http://orcid.org/) identifiers in
  the system, which will support more formalised attribution of
  community contributions to PomBase, and thereby enable researchers
  to cite community curation in institutional reports, funding
  applications, etc. To supplement the existing permanent
  publication-centred links in Canto, we are currently investigating
  possible ways to link to external resources such as ORCID or OpenRIF
  via ORCID IDs.
