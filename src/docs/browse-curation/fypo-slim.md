## Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology slim

A “slim” is a high-level subset of terms from an ontology, used to
analyze sets of annotated genes. The table below shows a slim set of
grouping terms that we have selected from the [Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology](/documentation/gene-page-phenotypes) (FYPO)
and the number of annotations to each term. FYPO IDs link to ${database_name}
ontology term pages. The annotation totals link to pages with
information about the term and a list of annotated genes. A gene may
be included in the annotation sets for more than one slim term.
