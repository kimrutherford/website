## Disease Ontology slim

A "slim" is a high-level subset of terms from an ontology, used to
analyze sets of annotated genes. The table below shows a slim set of
grouping terms that we have selected from the [Disease Ontology](http://www.disease-ontology.org/) (DO), 
and the number of annotations to each term. DO IDs link to PomBase
ontology term pages. The annotation totals link to pages with
information about the term and a list of annotated genes. A gene may
be included in the annotation sets for more than one slim term.

If you would like to have any terms added to the DO slim, please
contact the [helpdesk](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org).
