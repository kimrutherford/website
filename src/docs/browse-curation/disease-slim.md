## Monarch disease ontology slim

A “slim” is a high-level subset of terms from an ontology, used to
analyze sets of annotated genes. The table below shows a slim set of
grouping terms that we have selected from the [Monarch Disease Ontology](https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/) (MONDO)
and the number of annotations to each term. MONDO IDs link to PomBase
ontology term pages. The annotation totals link to pages with
information about the term and a list of annotated genes. A gene may
be included in the annotation sets for more than one slim term.

If you would like to have any terms added to the PomBase MONDO slim set, please
contact the [helpdesk](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org).
