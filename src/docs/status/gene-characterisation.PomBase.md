Protein-coding gene characterisation status descriptions

**Published:** Completely or partially characterised
in a small scale experiment, with some published information about the
biological role (corresponding to any of the [fission yeast GO
biological process slim](browse-curation/fission-yeast-bp-go-slim-terms) terms)

**Biological role inferred:** A biological role (as above, a [fission
yeast GO Process slim](browse-curation/fission-yeast-bp-go-slim-terms) term) is
inferred from homology to an experimentally characterised gene product

**Conserved protein (unknown biological role):** Conserved outside the <i>Schizosaccharomyces</i>,
but nothing known about the biological role in any organism

**<i>Schizosaccharomyces</i> specific protein, uncharacterized:**
Unpublished and found only in fission yeast (<i>S. pombe</i>, <i>S. octosporus</i>,
<i>S. japonicus</i>, <i>S. cryophilus</i>); nothing known about biological role.
May be single copy or a member of a multi-member family.

**<i>S. pombe</i> specific protein, uncharacterized:** Unpublished and
found only in <i>S. pombe</i> (not detected in other <i>Schizosaccharomyces</i>
species); nothing known about biological role

**Dubious:** Unlikely to be protein coding

**Transposon:** A predicted or experimentally verified transposable element.
