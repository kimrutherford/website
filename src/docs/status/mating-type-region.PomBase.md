## Mating type region

The *S. pombe* mating type loci are located on Chromosome 2. The reference strain 972 h- encodes the M-specific mating genes [II:2114008-2115135][Mc and Mi] at the expressed mat1 locus. The silent region mat3M is located at coordinates [II:2129208-2137121][mat]. Note that the silent mat2P region and cenH element are deleted in the reference strain.

A contig of the h90 configuration of the mat2P-mat3M region was created by Xavier Marsellach and Lorena Aguilar (Azor√≠n lab) using
available data and *S. pombe var. kambucha* as a scaffold. The contig can be viewed in the [genome browser][mat23]. Replacing the Chromosome 2 region spanning coordinates 2129208-2137121 with the separate contig sequence yields the Chromosome 2 contig of an
h90 strain.
