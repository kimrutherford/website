## Centromeres

At present, each centromere is annotated as a single sequence
feature in PomBase, which can be viewed in and downloaded from the
Ensembl genome browser.

Chromosome coordinates (links to JBrowse):

-   CEN 1: [I:3753687-3789421][cen1]
-   CEN 2: [II:1602264-1644747][cen2]
-   CEN 3: [III:1070904-1137003][cen3]

The 3 centromeres are also available as contiguated sequence (the
remaining gaps in CEN2 and CEN3 are represented by 100 N's)

-   [CEN 1](ftp://ftp.pombase.org/pombe/genome_sequence_and_features/feature_sequences/centromeres/cen1.gz) (gzipped EMBL format)
-   [CEN 2](ftp://ftp.pombase.org/pombe/genome_sequence_and_features/feature_sequences/centromeres/cen2.gz) (gzipped EMBL format)
-   [CEN 3](ftp://ftp.pombase.org/pombe/genome_sequence_and_features/feature_sequences/centromeres/cen3.gz) (gzipped EMBL format)

Note that specific repeats within centromeres cannot yet be viewed or
searched as features on PomBase pages, but they are included in the
forward and reverse strand feature tracks in the genome browser, which
are enabled by default.

Repeats are also shown in the diagram below. To see the repeat
sequences, download and unzip the [contiguated sequence files](ftp://ftp.pombase.org/pombe/genome_sequence_and_features/artemis_files/)
and view them in Artemis. (See
[this FAQ](/faq/is-there-an-equivalent-to-the-artemis-java-applet-in-pombase) for more
information.)

**Note:** Recent work by Chad Ellermeier and Gerry Smith suggests that
there are only 4 +/- 1 copies of the 6760 bp repeat missing from
chromosome 3

Please note: This map is a schematic diagram. Distances and overlaps are
approximate. Please refer to the sequence data to design experimental
constructs.
