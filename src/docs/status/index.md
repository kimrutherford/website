## Genome Status

| | |
|-|-|
| [Genome statistics](status/statistics) | Latest information on the status of the genome |
| [Sequencing status](status/sequencing-status) | Contig size, gap status and progress, including [centromeres](status/centromeres) and [telomeres](status/telomeres) |
| [Sequence updates](status/sequencing-updates) | Changes to the genome sequence since July 2003 |
| [Sequence updates pending](status/sequence-updates-pending) | Pending changes, mainly from the Broad Institute, some supported by data from other sources |
| [Gene coordinate changes](status/gene-coordinate-changes) | Changes to coordinates of individual genes since publication |
| [New and removed genes](status/new-and-removed-genes) | Genes identified or removed since publication |
| [Gene characterisation](status/gene-characterisation) | Current counts of protein coding gene status, as published in small scale experiments |
| [Historical gene characterisation](status/gene-characterisation-statistics-history) | Changes in gene characterisation statistics over time |
| [Priority unstudied genes](status/priority-unstudied-genes) | Unstudied nuclear-encoded protein-coding genes conserved 1:1 in human |
| [Unmapped genes](status/unmapped_genes) | List of genes identified genetically but not cloned or physically mapped |

Note: Many older *S. pombe* sequence submissions to the DNA databases
(International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration databases,
i.e. ENA, GenBank, DDBJ) contain one or more errors, and we do not have
the resources to maintain past sequences or flag every error in PomBase.
