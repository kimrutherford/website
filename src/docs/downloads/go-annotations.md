### GO annotations

*S. pombe* GO annotations are available from [PomBase](https://www.pombase.org/data/annotations/Gene_ontology/gene_association.pombase.gz)
or from the [GO repository](http://current.geneontology.org/annotations/pombase.gaf.gz)
(either link downloads a gzipped file). They include annotations
made by manual literature curation, annotations inferred from keyword
mappings based on curated descriptions, and annotations shared by the
UniProt [GOA](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) team. The file is tab-delimited
text, so it can be opened in a spreadsheet application or parsed with a
script. The default [GAF 2.2 format](http://geneontology.org/docs/go-annotation-file-gaf-format-2.2/)
is described on the GO website. 

Files are also available in the [${database_name} GO annotation
directory](https://www.pombase.org/data/annotations/Gene_ontology/) in
the older [GAF 2.1
format](http://geneontology.org/docs/go-annotation-file-gaf-format-2.1/)
and in a pair of companion formats currently under development at GO,
[GPAD](http://geneontology.org/docs/gene-product-association-data-gpad-format/)
and
[GPI](http://geneontology.org/docs/gene-product-information-gpi-format/).

Also see the [list of protein
complexes](https://www.pombase.org/data/annotations/Gene_ontology/GO_complexes/),
which uses GO macromolecular complex terms and IDs.

Note that the contents of the file downloadable from ${database_name} may
differ from files available elsewhere (e.g. see [this
FAQ](why-are-go-annotations-different-between-pombase-and-uniprot-goa),
and will not include annotations inferred by transitivity (see [this
FAQ](/faq/why-are-go-terms-missing-from-the-downloadable-annotation-file)).

Previous versions of the *S. pombe* GO annotation file can be
retrieved from the [archived Chado database
dumps](https://www.pombase.org/data/annotations/Gene_ontology/OLD/). Note
that files produced before March 2021 are only available in GAF 2.1
format.
