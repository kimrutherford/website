### GO annotations

<div style="color: red">
**Warning:** Files in the old FTP site within the EBI domain are no
  longer updated. If you have a link that contains **ftp.ebi.ac.uk**,
  please check these pages for a link using
  **pombase.org**. Please [contact the PomBase
  curators](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org) if you need help finding a
  file or directory.
</div>

*S. pombe* GO annotations are available from the [PomBase FTP site](https://www.pombase.org/data/annotations/Gene_ontology/gene_association.pombase.gz)
or from the [GO repository](http://current.geneontology.org/annotations/pombase.gaf.gz)
(either link downloads a gzipped file). They include annotations
made by manual literature curation, annotations inferred from keyword
mappings based on curated descriptions, and annotations shared by the
UniProt [GOA](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) team. The file is tab-delimited
text, so it can be opened in a spreadsheet application or parsed with a
script; the [format](http://geneontology.org/docs/go-annotation-file-gaf-format-21/)
is described on the GO website.

Also see the [list of protein complexes](https://www.pombase.org/data/annotations/Gene_ontology/GO_complexes/) 
in the FTP directory, which uses GO macromolecular complex terms and
IDs.

Note that the contents of the file downloadable from PomBase may
differ from files available elsewhere (e.g. see [this
FAQ](why-are-go-annotations-different-between-pombase-and-uniprot-goa),
and will not include annotations inferred by transitivity (see [this
FAQ](/faq/why-are-go-terms-missing-from-the-downloadable-annotation-file)).

Previous versions of the *S. pombe* GO annotation file can be retrieved
from the [PomBase FTP archive](https://www.pombase.org/data/annotations/Gene_ontology/OLD/).
