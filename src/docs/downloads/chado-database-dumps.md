## Chado database dumps

The [nightly release](ftp://ftp.pombase.org/nightly_update/) of
PomBase data includes a dump from the PomBase
[Chado](http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado) database.

Archived Chado data dumps are also available for
[download](http://curation.pombase.org/releases/). From January 2018
onwards, monthly data snapshots are provided. Earlier archived dumps
correspond to the intermittent PomBase releases made between July 2012
and January 2017. For these dumps, the file names include release
numbers that correspond to the "Annotation Version" numbers in the
[Data version history](/about/version-history) table.

Please [contact the curators](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org)
if you need any data not available at the links above.

The nightly release is on the PomBase FTP site. The other Chado dumps
can also be retrieved by [FTP](ftp://ftp.pombase.org/releases/) as
well as HTTP. For FTP downloads, connect as "guest" if prompted; see
[this FAQ](faq/do-i-need-password-download-ftp-site) for more
information.
