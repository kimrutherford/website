### PomBase name and identifier mappings

These files are available in the [names and IDs directory](https://www.pombase.org/data/names_and_identifiers/)

#### Systematic ID to UniProt accession number

-   [PomBase2UniProt.tsv](https://www.pombase.org/data/names_and_identifiers/PomBase2UniProt.tsv)
    tab-delimited file with the PomBase systematic identifier for each
    protein-coding gene mapped to the corresponding UniProt accession
    number

#### Gene names

-   [gene_IDs_names.tsv](https://www.pombase.org/data/names_and_identifiers/gene_IDs_names.tsv)
    tab-delimited file of systematic ID, primary gene name (where
    assigned), and all synonyms for each gene

-   [gene_IDs_names_products.tsv](https://www.pombase.org/data/names_and_identifiers/gene_IDs_names_products.tsv)
    tab-delimited file of systematic ID, primary gene name (where
    assigned), chromosome, product description, UniProtKB accession,
    all synonyms, and product type (protein coding, ncRNA, etc.) for
    each gene

#### Systematic ID to gene product

Files include systematic name, primary name (where assigned),
synonyms (where assigned), and gene product description

-   [sysID2product.tsv](https://www.pombase.org/data/names_and_identifiers/sysID2product.tsv)
    protein-coding genes
-   [sysID2product.rna.tsv](https://www.pombase.org/data/names_and_identifiers/sysID2product.rna.tsv)
    non-coding RNA genes
-   [pseudogeneIDs.tsv](https://www.pombase.org/data/names_and_identifiers/pseudogeneIDs.tsv)
    pseudogenes

Note: A tab-delimited file of systematic identifiers mapped to EC
numbers was previously maintained, but has not been updated since March
2012. The most recent version of the
[gp2EC.txt](https://www.pombase.org/data/names_and_identifiers/OLD/gp2EC.txt)
file is available in the archive, but because it is out of date it
may contain errors or omissions.
