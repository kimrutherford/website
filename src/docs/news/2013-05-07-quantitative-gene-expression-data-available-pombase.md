### Quantitative gene expression data available in PomBase

We have extended the Gene Expression section of each gene page to
support the display of quantitative expression data, and are now showing
data from two publications:

-   Marguerat S, Schmidt A, Codlin S, Chen W, Aebersold R,
    BÃ¤hlerJ. 2012. "Quantitative analysis of fission yeast
    transcriptomes and proteomes in proliferating and quiescent cells."
    *Cell* **151:**671-683.
-   Wu JQ, Pollard TD. 2005. "Counting cytokinesis proteins globally and
    locally in fission yeast." *Science* **310:**310-314.

We will also soon refine the display of the new expression data, and can
add more datasets upon request. We thank Sam Marguerat for preparing the
data from both papers for inclusion in PomBase.

We have also updated the PomBase site to include manual curation through
April 4, 2013, and we have updated the "all gene names" file on the
PomBase ftp site. The new file is available at\
<ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pombase/pombe/Mappings/gene_IDs_names.tsv>
