PomBase has released a new, interactive display for protein features
on gene pages. The new view is clearer, with details for each feature
available via mouseover as well as in the accompanying table.

In addition, PomBase now uses InterPro Version 84.0, which includes
205 new entries and integrates 252 new methods from the Pfam, PANTHER,
and CDD databases. See the [InterPro release
notes](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/release_notes/) for further
information.
