We have loaded the [Grech et al. (2019) "Fitness Landscape of the Fission Yeast Genome"](https://www.pombase.org/reference/PMID:31077324) dataset into JBrowse. In this study, transposon mutagenesis libraries were created to map transposon insertion sites in the S. pombe genome. From this data, functional elements of the genome were inferred. The tracks from this study can be loaded by a single click from the linked publication page above

Thanks Dan Jeffares for sending us the data.

For anyone new to JBrowse we have a [quick start guide](https://www.pombase.org/documentation/JBrowse_quick_start).
