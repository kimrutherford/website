### New nucleosome occupancy maps loaded
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: browser.png -->

We have loaded the nucleosome occupancy maps as described in Gonz√°lez et al. (2016) [PMID: 27662899](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27662899). This dataset was generated using the paired-end sequencing protocol of Illumina and thus those maps are of higher resolution than those made with single-end (SE) sequencing hosted in the browser since before.

Here is a link that [loads the tracks in PomBase JBrowse](https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/?loc=II%3A2751621..2767510&tracks=PomBase%20forward%20strand%20features%2CPomBase%20reverse%20strand%20features%2Cnucleosome%20positioning%20during%20vegetative%20growth%3B%20repeat%201%20-%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20et%20al.%20%282016%29%2Cnucleosome%20positioning%20during%20vegetative%20growth%3B%20repeat%202%20-%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20et%20al.%20%282016%29%2CDNA%20sequence&highlight=).

Many thanks to Paco Antequera for sending us the bigwig files! If you would like us to load any datasets then please get in touch.
