### Quarter of a million annotations
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: quarter_mill.png -->

PomBase recently reached 250,000 annotations to controlled
vocabularies and ontologies. The majority (over 90%) are assigned
manually from fission yeast experimental data derived from 3776
publications, most of which report low-throughput, hypothesis-driven experiments.

You can query and combine any of these data types in the
[Advanced search](https://www.pombase.org/query).

Thank you to everyone who contributed to this significant achievement
through community curation.
