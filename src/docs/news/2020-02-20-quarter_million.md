### Quarter of a million annotations
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->
PomBase recently reached 250,000 annotations to controlled vocabularies and ontologies. The majority, (over 90%) are assigned manually from fission yeast experimental data derived from 3776, mainly low-throughput, hypothesis-driven publications.
You can query and combine any of these data types here: https://www.pombase.org/query
Thank you to everyone who contributed to this significant achievement through community curation.
