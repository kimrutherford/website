[Read more](/news/2020-09-11-hermes-transposon-data-long) about the
new data in PomBase from Henry Levin's lab: [Lee et
al. 2020](/reference/PMID:32101745) applied
Hermes and Transposon Integration Sequencing to identify genes
important for the formation of heterochromatin. Insertion sites from
eight independent cultures can be visualized from PomBase as custom
tracks on Jbrowse, and additional data are visible on the [publication
page](/reference/PMID:32101745) and gene
pages. The lab has also provided a
[summary](/news/2020-09-11-hermes-transposon-data-long) of the work.
