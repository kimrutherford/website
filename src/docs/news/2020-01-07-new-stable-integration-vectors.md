To enable fission yeast researchers to manipulate *S. pombe* molecular
biology reproducibly and easily, Aleks Vje≈°tica and Magdalena Marek in
Sophie Martin's lab have designed and constructed a series of simple,
fully characterized plasmids.

The Stable Integration Vector (SIV) series provides a highly modular
toolbox to introduce heterologous sequences more stably was possible
with than previously available vectors. The toolkit includes
antibiotic resistance markers, promoters, fluorescent tags, and
terminators, as well as large set of ready-to-use fluorescent probes
to mark organelles and visualize cellular processes.

The work is published in the [Journal of Cell Science](https://jcs.biologists.org/content/early/2019/11/29/jcs.240754.long),
and a PomBase [publication page](https://www.pombase.org/reference/PMID:31801797) is available.
