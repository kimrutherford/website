### Improved gene-disease curation
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: human disease.png -->

PomBase disease gene curation associates disease descriptors with
fission yeast orthologs of human disease-causing genes. We have now
increased coverage by adding new gene&ndash;disease term connections,
with 3954 individual annotations to 1195 genes (up from 2588 and 905
respectively in January 2019). Disease associations now cover 24.5% of
all fission yeast protein-coding genes, and over one third of those
with human orthologs.
