### PomBase launches community curation

At the pombe 2013 conference in London, PomBase officially launched its
community curation initiative, which allows researchers to contribute
publication-based annotations directly to the database. PomBase curators
invite lab heads by individual email to curate newly published papers,
providing links to the online curation system and its documentation.
Researchers can also initiate curation of any older fission yeast
publication in PubMed. Community curation uses the open-source online
tool [Canto](http://curation.pombase.org/pombe/).
