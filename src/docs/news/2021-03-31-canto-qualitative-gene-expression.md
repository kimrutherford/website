### Qualitative gene expression annotation in Canto
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: canto.png -->

Canto, PomBase's online curation tool, now supports qualitative gene
expression annotation. Two new annotation types are available to
represent observations about the levels of RNA or protein observed in
wild-type cells, and how they change over the cell cycle or in
response to a stimulus. See the [Canto
documentation](https://curation.pombase.org/pombe/docs/gene_expression)
for more information. We have also updated the display of qualitative
gene expression on PomBase gene and publication pages.
