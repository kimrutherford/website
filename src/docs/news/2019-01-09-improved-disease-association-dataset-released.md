### Improved disease association dataset released

<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->

We are pleased to announce the release of our improved human disease
mappings dataset. This dataset connects human disease causing genes to
their _S. pombe_ orthologs.

Diseases are now mapped to the Disease Ontology (DO) and the dataset has been
extended by data from Malacards. All disease associations can be accessed from
the [top level disease page](/term/DOID:4). A disease
slim has been created to facilitate browsing of disease categories. Currently,
907 S. pombe genes are associated with disease (up from 610 in the original
dataset). This number is due to increase as mappings are still in progress.

Many thanks to DO and Malacards for help in improving this annotation set. Icon
