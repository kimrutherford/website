### GO annotations from PAINT
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: go-logo-icon.mini.png -->

PomBase now includes over 3000 GO annotations made using Phylogenetic
Annotation and INference Tool (PAINT), developed by the GO Consortium
to infer protein function in a phylogenetic context, supporting
precise assertions as to when functions were gained and lost during
evolution. PAINT annotations use the evidence code ["inferred from
biological aspect of ancestor"
(IBA)](http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Inferred_from_Biological_aspect_of_Ancestor_(IBA)). PAINT
curation is described in more detail in [Gaudet *et al.*
2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21873635/).
