### Chromatin silencing ontology &amp; annotation overhaul
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->

PomBase curators have collaborated with the GO Consortium to improve
the representation of chromatin silencing and the underlying
heterochromatin organization processes in the GO biological process
ontology and annotations.

Notably, "chromatin silencing" terms have been removed from GO on the
grounds that they conflated various heterochromatin assembly,
formation, and maintenance pathways with processes that affect
chromatin-mediated repression more indirectly (e.g. tethering to the
nuclear envelope). Chromatin silencing is a phenotype resulting from
the cumulative effects of these processes, and the Fission Yeast
Phenotype Ontology (FYPO) accordingly retains a full suite of
"chromatin silencing" terms.

Annotations using the GO chromatin silencing terms were reviewed, and
either removed or reannotated based on what could be inferred from the
phenotypes, resulting in a substantially revised set of
[heterochromatin assembly annotations](https://www.pombase.org/term/GO:0031507). 
Further work is required, so please [send us](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org) any corrections.
