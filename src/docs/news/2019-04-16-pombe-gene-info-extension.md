*S. pombe* gene information is now included in the [Gene Info](https://gene-info.org/) extension (GIX) for the Chrome and Firefox web browsers. GIX allows you to retrieve information about a gene product directly on any webpage simply by double clicking an official gene name, synonym or supported accession. Searching or double-clicking on text terms retrieves gene function annotation, GO terms, external database links, and interaction data drawn from BioGRID and IntAct. Retrieved gene names are automatically hyperlinked for rapid recursive searches.

GeneInfo is fully open source, available online at [GitHub](https://github.com/knightjdr/gene-info/). Tutorial videos, a step-by-step guide, and download links for Firefox Add-ons and the Chrome web storeare available [online](https://gene-info.org/). GeneInfo was developed by James Knight in the [Gingras Lab](https://gingraslab.lunenfeld.ca/) at the [Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute](http://www.lunenfeld.ca/) in Toronto, Canada.
