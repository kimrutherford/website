### New fission yeast GO slims
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: dropdown_menu.png -->

To complement the overview provided by the [fission yeast GO
biological process
slim](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-bp-go-slim-terms), we have
created GO slims for the [molecular
function](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-mf-go-slim-terms) and
[cellular component](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-cc-go-slim-terms)
branches of GO. Each slim page provides links to ontology term pages,
annotated genes, and to download slim terms and IDs from the PomBase
ftp site.
