### PomBase data update

We have updated the data available on the PomBase web site to include
manual curation through February 2, 2015, including 245
community-curated publications. On the gene pages, the interaction
tables now provides a bit of descriptive text for each annotation,
indicating the nature and direction of the interaction.
