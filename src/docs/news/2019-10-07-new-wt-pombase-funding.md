We are pleased to announce that the recent PomBase application for
continued Wellcome Trust funding was successful.  Although the grant
was not fully funded, we are confident that we can cover the shortfall
by small grants for stand-alone projects and collaborations.  We would
like to thank the pombe community for their support with the
application, and the Wellcome Trust for their continued funding.  We
look forward to supporting your research until 2025 (and beyond).
