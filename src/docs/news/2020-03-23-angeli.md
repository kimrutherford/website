### Angeli update
<!-- SOME STUFF TO COMMENT OUT -->
AnGeLi (developed by Danny Bitton) is an enrichment tool that allows you to perform enrichments over gene lists. 
Angeli was recently updated with PomBase ontology data from 04-03-2020 to provide 9320 lists including ontology 
terms annotated by PomBase, and many additional datasets from the Bahler laboratory.
