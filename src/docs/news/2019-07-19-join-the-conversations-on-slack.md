The vibrant fission yeast community now has a Slack channel.  Slack
provides a forum for the research community. Follow conversations you
care about, message colleagues privately, or in groups, ask questions,
post responses.  All archived and searchable.

 - See the [PombeSlack flyer](/assets/external_media/PombeSlack-flyer.pdf) for more information, including how to join.
