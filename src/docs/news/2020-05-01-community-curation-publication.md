### Published: Community curation in PomBase

<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: canto.png -->

The PomBase team has published an overview of our experience with
community curation for fission yeast. In the article, out this week in
[Database](https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/baaa028/5827230),
we reflect on the factors that have made our community's remarkable,
standard-setting achievements possible, and on the benefits we and
PomBase users derive from this effort. We highlight the collaboration
between authors and professional curators that arises via community
curation, and how annotation quality improves as a result.
