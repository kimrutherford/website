### New PomBase genomic region graphics
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: browser.png -->

PomBase gene pages now use interactive graphics from PomBase JBrowse
to depict the genomic region around the gene. Drag to scroll left and
right, double-click to zoom in, shift-double-click to zoom out, and
click a feature to see details in a popup. The "Full-screen view" link
in the corner opens the fully functional JBrowse in a new tab or
window. Reloading a gene page restores the display to the default
location and zoom level.
