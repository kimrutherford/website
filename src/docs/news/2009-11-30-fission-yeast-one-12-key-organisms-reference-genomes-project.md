### Fission yeast is one of the 12 key organisms of the reference genomes project

Fission yeast is one of the 12 key organisms of the [reference genomes
project](http://geneontology.org/GO.refgenome.shtml?all). The goal of
this project is to completely annotate twelve reference genomes so that
those annotations may be used to effectively seed the automatic
annotation efforts of other genome.
