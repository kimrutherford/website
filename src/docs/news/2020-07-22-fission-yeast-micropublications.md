PomBase has recently joined [microPublication.org](https://www.micropublication.org/), which "publishes brief, novel findings, negative and/or reproduced results, and results which may lack a broader scientific narrative", as a Partner Database. Fission yeast researchers can thus now make any results available to the community, even those that don't fit neatly into traditional publications.

Visit the [microPublications website](https://www.micropublication.org/) to learn more, to [register](https://www.micropublication.org/submit-new-article/) and submit your data, or sign up to review. Send questions to the [PomBase helpdesk](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org).
