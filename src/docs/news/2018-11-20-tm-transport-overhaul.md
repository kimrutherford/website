### Fission yeast transmembrane transport overhaul
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: antiporter.png -->

The Gene Ontology "[transmembrane transport](https://www.pombase.org/term_genes/GO:0055085)"
branch has recently been substantially revised. In line with these
revisions, PomBase has standardised gene product descriptions for
transporters, and overhauled GO annotations to be as complete and
comprehensive as possible based on current knowledge.
