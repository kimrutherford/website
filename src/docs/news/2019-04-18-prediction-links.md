### New external links from gene pages

<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: tree_for_news.png -->

We have added new external links to PomBase gene pages for structure
and ortholog predictions:

- Protein-specific links to
  [SWISS-MODEL](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/), a fully automated
  protein structure homology-modelling server, accessible via the
  ExPASy web server, lead to a SWISS-MODEL Repository page for each
  sequence and present results. If no structure or model is available,
  you can either trigger adding an entry to the repository with a
  single click or easily interactively search for templates and build
  models in your own SWISS-MODEL workspace.

- Ensembl Fungi Compara and Ensembl Pan-taxonomic Compara links lead
  to orthology predictions from the Ensembl Compara pipeline for fungi
  and all species, respectively.

- [PANTHER](http://www.pantherdb.org/) links retrieve gene
  information, classification, and predicted orthologs.
