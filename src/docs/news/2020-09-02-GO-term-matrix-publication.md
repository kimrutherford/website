In collaboration with the GO Consortium, the PomBase team has
published a report on the **Term Matrix** approach to GO annotation
quality control. The article, out this week in [Open
Biology](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsob.200149),
describes biological processes that do, or don't, share annotated gene
products, and how we use co-annotation patterns to build rules to
detect, correct, and prevent errors.
