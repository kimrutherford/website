# What is bedGraph format?
<!-- pombase_categories: Data submission and formats -->

BedGraph is a file format that allows display of continuous-valued data
in a track in genome browsers that support the format.

At present, JBrowse does not support bedGraph, so we cannot use data
in this format for ${database_name}. If you have data in bedGraph format, we
recommend converting to WIG or bigWig format.

BedGraph format is described at the [UCSC Genome Bioinformatics web site](http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bedgraph.html), and the
[Broad Institute file format guide](http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/bedgraph) provides
additional information.
