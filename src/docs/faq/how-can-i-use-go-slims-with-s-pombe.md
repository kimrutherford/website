# How can I use GO slims with S. pombe?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome statistics and lists,Tools and resources,Using ontologies -->

The [Fission Yeast GO slim pages](documentation/pombase-go-slim-documentation)
provide generic GO slims for *S. pombe*, and show total genes
annotated to each term directly or to any of its descendants.

If you want GO slim annotations for your own list of *S. pombe* genes,
use the advanced search "Gene names and IDs" option, and then use the "Slim"
button on the search results page. See the [advanced search
documentation](documentation/advanced-search) for more information.

If you want to use a different slim, we recommend using the [GO Term
Mapper](http://go.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/GOTermMapper) at Princeton.
Upload your list of genes, and select "Schizosaccharomyces pombe
(PomBase)" in the Organism pulldown. For the slim, select one of the
radio buttons, or scroll down to Advanced Options to choose GO terms
to make up a custom slim. GO Term Mapper's interface and documentation
should make the rest straightforward, but let PomBase staff know if
you have any problems.

For further information on using the generic *S. pombe* slim, or on
creating your own GO slim, please see the [Fission Yeast GO slimming tips](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-go-slimming-tips) page.
