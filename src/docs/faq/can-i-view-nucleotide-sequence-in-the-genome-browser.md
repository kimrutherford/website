# Can I view nucleotide sequence in the genome browser?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome browser,Tools and resources -->

Yes. First, make sure the DNA sequence track is enabled
(see the [FAQ on showing tracks](/faq/how-can-i-show-or-hide-tracks-genome-browser)
if necessary).

Then simply zoom in until sequence appears. The graphic will first
display colored blocks representing color-coded nucleotides, and then
legible sequence.

At any zoom level, use the arrows to scroll along the sequence.

See [this FAQ](/faq/how-can-i-display-sequence-region-using-sequence-coordinates-genome-browser)
to display a sequence region using coordinates. For more information on downloading sequence,
see the [${database_name} JBrowse guide](/documentation/JBrowse_quick_start).
