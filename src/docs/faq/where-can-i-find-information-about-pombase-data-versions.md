# Where can I find information about PomBase data versions?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome statistics and lists -->

PomBase annotations are updated each time the daily upload to the
preview site (behind the scenes) succeeds, with snapshots
archived on a monthly basis. To refer to PomBase in your publications,
we recommend citing the date on which you view or download data. If
you download an archived snapshot, cite its date.

Prior to the September 2017 PomBase upgrade, periodic data releases
were flagged with version numbers and release dates. Each legacy
version number has two parts, of which the first is the Ensembl
Genomes (EG) version and the second is the version of curated PomBase
annotations (sequence features, ontology annotations, etc.). For
example, PomBase version 20_39 used EG version 20 and PomBase
annotation data version 39. The [Data version history](/about/version-history) 
page shows additional information about the versions of various data
and software portions of the legacy PomBase releases.
