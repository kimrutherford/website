# How can I submit high-throughput data to ${database_name}?
<!-- pombase_categories: Data submission and formats,Genome browser -->

${database_name} welcomes large sets of published data. The recommended
submission route depends on the data type:

- For any data that can be associated with genome sequence coordinates
    (e.g. gene expression, ChIP-seq protein localisation, variation,
    etc.), we can add data tracks to JBrowse. Please see the [HTP data
    submission page](/documentation/data-submission-form-for-HTP-sequence-linked-data)
    for instructions and submission templates.
- Several types of data associated with genes can be displayed on gene
    pages. ${database_name} has developed bulk upload formats for phenotype,
    modification, and gene expression data -- see the [Annotation data
    submission page](/submit-data/bulk-annotation) and the [FAQ on file
    formats](/faq/what-file-formats-can-i-use-submit-high-throughput-data)
    for links to the file format descriptions and data submission forms.

If you have any other type of large-scale data -- or if you have
problems or questions regarding the available submission forms -- please
contact the [helpdesk](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org).
