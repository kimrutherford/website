# How can I get my data into ${database_name}?
<!-- pombase_categories: Data submission and formats,Genome browser -->

The best route depends on the amount and type of data you have.

-   If you have a published paper with "small-scale" data (a few genes,
    several different data types, etc.), you can curate it in
    [Canto](http://curation.pombase.org/pombe), ${database_name}'s online
    [community curation](/community/fission-yeast-community-curation-project) tool.
    The [Canto documentation](http://curation.pombase.org/pombe/docs/index/) describes
    the supported data types (Gene Ontology, phenotypes, interactions,
    modifications) and how to use the curation interface.
-   If you have data from large-scale experiments that is associated
    with sequence coordinates, it can be displayed as a track in
    ${database_name} JBrowse. See the [data submission page](/submit-data) for
    instructions.
<!-- Use the [HTP data submission form](/submit-data/data-submission-form) to send details. -->
-   If you have a large set of phenotype data (e.g. from a screen of the
    deletion collection), especially if there are many annotations to
    one or a few
    [FYPO](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-phenotype-ontology) term(s),
    you can send them to the helpdesk in the 
    [phenotype annotation spreadsheet format](/documentation/phenotype-data-bulk-upload-format).
-   Similarly, we can accept sets of GO, modification, or gene
    expression data as described on the [dataset submission
    page](/submit-data/bulk-annotation).
-   For large sets of genetic or physical interaction data, we recommend
    that you prepare a spreadsheet using the [template provided by BioGRID](http://wiki.thebiogrid.org/doku.php/contribute) 
    (see "Step 1. Send Us Your Interaction Data"). You are welcome to send
    the spreadsheet either to BioGRID or to ${database_name} (via the helpdesk);
    ${database_name} and BioGRID exchange data regularly so all interactions will
    appear in both databases.

You can do both Canto curation and large-scale data submission for a
single publication, if it reports both large- and small-scale
experimental results.

For any data types not listed above, or if you have any questions,
please contact the [${database_name} helpdesk](mailto:${helpdesk_address}).
