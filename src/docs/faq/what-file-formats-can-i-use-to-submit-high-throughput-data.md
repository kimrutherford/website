# What file formats can I use to submit high-throughput data?
<!-- pombase_categories: Data submission and formats -->

At present, ${database_name} can host any types of data that can be connected
with sequence features or coordinates, and can display the data as
tracks in the genome browser. We accept data in any of several
formats. To choose a file format for your data, consult the table
below and the linked FAQs. 

Also please see the [HTP data submission
page](/documentation/data-submission-form-for-HTP-sequence-linked-data)
for instructions and submission templates, and [consult the
helpdesk](mailto:${helpdesk_address}) to submit a file or if you need
further assistance.

<!-- [accept data](/submit-data/data-submission-form) in any of several formats. -->

File format | Recommended for
------------|----------------
[BAM](/faq/what-bam-format) | sequence alignments, especially from high-throughput experiments such as RNAseq
[BED](/faq/what-bed-format) | sequence features with coordinates
[bigBed](/faq/what-bigbed-format) | sequence features with coordinates
[bigWig](/faq/what-bigwig-format) | values attached to genome locations/regions
[GFF3](/faq/what-gff3) | sequence features with coordinates
[VCF](/faq/what-vcf) | structural variations, such as SNPs, insertions, deletions, or copy number variants
[WIG](/faq/what-wig-format) | values attached to genome locations/regions
<!-- [PSL](/faq/what-psl-format) | sequence alignments -->

We can also accept batch submissions of certain types of data that
appear on ${database_name} gene pages. For these data types, we use dedicated
${database_name}-specific formats as shown in the table:

Data type | File format description
----------|------------------------
Phenotypes | [phenotype file format](/documentation/phenotype-data-bulk-upload-format) 
Modifications | [modification file format](/documentation/modification-data-bulk-upload-format) 
Qualitative gene expression | [qualitative gene expression file format](/faq/how-can-i-submit-high-throughput-data-pombase) 
Quantitative gene expression | [quantitative gene expression file format](/faq/how-can-i-submit-high-throughput-data-pombase) 

We may be able to accept data in other text formats. Please enquire via
the ${database_name} [helpdesk](mailto:${helpdesk_address}) if you have any questions about your data format.
