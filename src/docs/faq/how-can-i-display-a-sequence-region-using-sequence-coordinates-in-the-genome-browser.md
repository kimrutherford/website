# How can I display a sequence region using sequence coordinates in the genome browser?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome browser,Finding data -->

Go to the [genome browser](https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/), and
enter coordinates in the location box. The format is
'I:100000..200000' (i.e. use Roman numerals to specify the chromosome,
and don't include the word "chromosome"; use '..' between the start
and end coordinates.)

You can also choose a chromosome from the pulldown, and enter just the
numbers specifying position in the location box.

To see the DNA sequence, see [this FAQ](faq/can-i-view-nucleotide-sequence-genome-browser). 
For more information on downloading sequence, see the 
[PomBase JBrowse guide](/documentation/JBrowse_quick_start).
