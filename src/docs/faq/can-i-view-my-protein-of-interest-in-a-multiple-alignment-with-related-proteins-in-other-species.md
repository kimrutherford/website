# Can I view my protein of interest in a multiple alignment with related proteins in other species?
<!-- pombase_categories: Orthology,Tools and resources -->

PomBase does not have its own alignment viewer. DIOPT, Compara, and
PANTHER, three of the tools we recommend for finding orthologs, have
alignment display options. See the [FAQ on orthologs in other
species](faq/how-can-i-find-s.-pombe-orthologs-species-other-than-human-and-s.-cerevisiae)
for more information.
