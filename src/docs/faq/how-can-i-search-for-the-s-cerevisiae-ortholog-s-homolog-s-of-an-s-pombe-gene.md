# How can I search for the *S. cerevisiae* ortholog(s)/homolog(s) of an *S. pombe* gene?
<!-- pombase_categories: Orthology,Finding data -->

In PomBase, *S. cerevisiae* orthologs are curated for *S. pombe* genes as
described in the [Orthologs documentation](/documentation/orthologs).

To find *S. pombe* orthologs for a budding yeast gene, you can search
for the systematic name (ORF name) or the SGD ID (e.g. SGD:S000001123)
of the *S. cerevisiae* gene in the simple search box in the page
header. For example, *S. cerevisiae* *LRP1* has the systematic name
YHR081W, and a search on this in PomBase will retrieve the *S. pombe*
gene *cti1*. Note that only systematic names or SGD IDs can be
searched for *S. cerevisiae*, to avoid confusion in cases where
unrelated genes coincidentally have the same name in *S. pombe* and
*S. cerevisiae*. To find systematic names of *S. cerevisiae* genes,
you can search [SGD](https://www.yeastgenome.org/).
