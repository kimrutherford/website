# What is an annotation extension?
<!-- pombase_categories: Using ontologies -->

Annotation extensions can be used with annotations to terms from various
ontologies, such as GO, FYPO, modifications, etc. Extensions provide
additional specificity to the annotation by linking the term to another
ontology term or a gene product via a relationship.

Extensions are most commonly used with GO annotations, where they can be
used to capture details such as substrates of molecular functions or
cell cycle phases during which a localization is observed. More
information is available in the [gene page GO annotation documentation](/documentation/gene-page-gene-ontology). The GO
Consortium provides further information on annotation extensions in its
[annotation documentation](http://geneontology.org/page/annotation-extension),
including the [file format guide](http://www.geneontology.org/page/go-annotation-file-format-20),
on a [wiki page](http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Annotation_Extension), and
in a
[publication](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/155/abstract).
PomBase converts many extension names to more human-friendly text, as
described
[here](/documentation/annotation-extension-relation-display).

Phenotype annotations using FYPO may have extensions that capture
expressivity (severity) or penetrance, or identify a gene or gene
product used in an assay, as described in the [gene page phenotype documentation](/documentation/gene-page-phenotypes).
