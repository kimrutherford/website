# Can I find unmapped genes in PomBase?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data,Genome statistics and lists -->

PomBase maintains a [list of genetic loci that have not been cloned or mapped](/status/unmapped_genes). 
The page lists the names published for the loci and the publications
that use the names. In a few cases, unmapped loci have been shown to
be allelic with each other.

Note that some locus names coincidentally match the standard names of
cloned genes. In these cases PomBase curators have determined that the
unmapped locus is not the same as the named gene.
