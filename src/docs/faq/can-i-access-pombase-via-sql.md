# Can I access PomBase via SQL?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data,Tools and resources -->

PomBase does not have a publicly accessible SQL query server, but
[Chado database dumps](/downloads/chado-database-dumps) (PostgresQL)
are available to download and query locally.

The [Ensembl Fungi MySQL database](https://fungi.ensembl.org/info/data/mysql.html) 
server does provide access to query *S. pombe* data. Note, however,
that Ensembl Genomes (EG) is updated much less frequently than
PomBase, so EG data will rarely be as up-to-date as the PomBase web
site.

MySQL dumps of EG data, including *Schizosaccharomyces* species, are
available from [EG's FTP site](ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/current/fungi/mysql/).
