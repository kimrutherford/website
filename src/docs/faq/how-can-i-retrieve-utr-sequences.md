# How can I retrieve UTR sequences?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data -->

Transcript start and end coordinates from all sources will be
available as individual data tracks in the genome browser in the near
future, which will allow you to view, evaluate and download them. We
also provide downloadable UTR data sets that are updated periodically,
available on the [Genome sequence and features](/downloads/genome-datasets) page.

%%if db=PomBase
Also see the [precedence criteria](/faq/how-does-pombase-determine-gene-s-full-length-transcript-utr-coordinates-transcription-start-and-end-sites)
used to choose default UTR features to display on gene pages.
%%end db=PomBase

To retrieve UTRs for a specified list of genes, see the FAQ on
[downloading sequences for multiple genes](/faq/can-i-download-sequences-many-genes-once-including-flanking-regions) (choose
5' UTR and/or 3' UTR in the popup).
