# Can I provide a list of genes to search on?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data -->

Yes, you can type or paste a list, or upload a file, into the "Gene
names and IDs" query in the [advanced search](/query). Note that usisg
systematic IDs is the best way to avoid ambiguity. Names or IDs can be
separated by spaces, commas, or newlines. Click "Lookup" to retrieve
the results. You can use the list in the query history to combine with
other queries, or download selected details for the genes. See the
[documentation](/documentation/advanced-search) to learn more.
