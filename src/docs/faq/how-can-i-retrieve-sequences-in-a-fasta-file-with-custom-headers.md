# How can I retrieve sequences in a FASTA file with custom headers?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data -->

You can customize the headers for FASTA files of downloaded results
from the advanced search (i.e. for any list of genes). The Download
dialog offers several options for items to include in the headers. See
the [advanced search documentation](documentation/advanced-search) for
more information.
