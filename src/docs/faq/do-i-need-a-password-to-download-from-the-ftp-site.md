# Do I need a password to download from the FTP site?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data,Genome statistics and lists,Tools and resources -->

You do not need a password to download anything from the PomBase FTP
site. In some web browsers, clicking a link to an FTP directory takes
you to a page listing the contents, and clicking a file link produces
a dialog box asking whether to open or save the file. Other browsers
require a separate connection step:

- If your browser asks "Do you want to allow this page to ...?", answer
  "yes" or "allow".

- If you're prompted to "connect as guest or registered user", select
  "guest".

You should then be able to connect and download files (note: we have
observed that this step can be sensitive to slow network connections).

If these steps don't work, please let us know via the
[Helpdesk](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org), and we will try to assist
you.
