# Can I access PomBase via an API?
<!-- pombase_categories: Tools and resources -->

PomBase does not have an API at present.

The Ensembl API can be used to query *S. pombe* data. Note, however,
that EG is updated much less frequently than PomBase, so EG data will
rarely be as up-to-date as the PomBase web site. Documentation is
available:

1.  [Ensembl Genomes Perl API installation and basic use instructions](http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/index.html) (with links to additional Ensembl API documentation)
2.  [Tutorial for using the API with the core database](http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/core/core_tutorial.html) -
    Includes examples about connecting to the database, retrieving
    chromosomes, genes, transcript and translations along with the
    corresponding xrefs.
