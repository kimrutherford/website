# How can I retrieve a gene sequence, including upstream and downstream sequences?
<!-- pombase_categories: Gene page,Genome browser,Finding data -->

You can retrieve sequences from a gene page or in the genome browser,
although flanking sequences are only available from gene pages at
present.

**On the gene page**: Scroll down or click the left-hand menu link to the
Sequence section of the page, where a DNA sequence is displayed by
default. For protein-coding genes, the CDS is shown, and you can click
boxes to add the sequences of any annotated introns or 5' or 3'
UTRs. To include flanking sequences, enter a number of nucleotides in
the "upstream" and/or "downstream" boxes. Only applicable options
appear for non-coding RNA genes. The "Download sequence" button saves
a FASTA file with your selection.

**To use the Genome Browser**: Click the "View in JBrowse" link under
the map graphic on a gene page. In the browser, click on any feature
to show a popup with details, including the sequence. Use controls in
the popup to save FASTA sequence.

To retrieve flanking regions for more than one gene at a time, see
