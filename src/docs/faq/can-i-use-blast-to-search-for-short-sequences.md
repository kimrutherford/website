# Can I use BLAST to search for short sequences?
<!-- pombase_categories: Tools and resources -->

Yes, you can search for short nucleotide sequences, such as primers or
other oligomers. We recommend NCBI BLAST, where you can search for
short nucleotide sequences, such as primers or other oligomers
(${database_name} does not maintain its own BLAST server).

For short peptide sequences, we recommend the ${database_name} 
[peptide motif search](/motif_search).
