# Can I download sequences for many genes at once, including flanking regions? 
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data -->

Yes; first use the [advanced search](/query) to find the set of genes
you want (see the [documentation](/documentation/advanced-search) as
needed).

Click on a count in the query history to see the
[results](documentation/advanced-search), with a button for "Download"
options. In the popup, click on the Sequence tab, select Nucleotide,
then tick boxes to add any of: 5' UTR, introns, 3' UTR. To include
flanking sequences, type or use the arrow buttons to set the desired
length of upstream and downstream sequence.
