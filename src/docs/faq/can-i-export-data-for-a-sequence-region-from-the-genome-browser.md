# Can I export data for a sequence region from the genome browser?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome browser,Finding data -->

To download track data from the [genome
browser](${base_url}/jbrowse/) (or follow a link from a
gene page), first, make sure the you have enabled the track(s) of
interest (see the [FAQ on showing
tracks](/faq/how-can-i-show-or-hide-tracks-genome-browser) if
necessary).

Next select a region by [entering
coordinates](/faq/how-can-i-display-sequence-region-using-sequence-coordinates-genome-browser)
or by highlighting it. For any data track, click on the end of the
track label to show the dropdown menu, and choose "Save track
data". In the popup that appears, choose a data format, edit the file
name if desired, and click "Save".

Most track data are available in GFF3 format; other options will
depend on the data type (e.g. BED, Wiggle, etc.).

See the [${database_name} JBrowse guide](/documentation/JBrowse_quick_start)
for more information.
