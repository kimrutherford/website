# How can I retrieve the sequence of a region using sequence coordinates?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome browser,Finding data -->

Go to the [genome browser](https://${base_url}/jbrowse/), and make
sure the DNA sequence track is enabled (see the [FAQ on showing tracks](/faq/how-can-i-show-or-hide-tracks-genome-browser)
if necessary). Enter region coordinates (as described in [this
FAQ](https://www.pombase.org/faq/how-can-i-display-sequence-region-using-sequence-coordinates-genome-browser)).

In the "DNA sequence" track label, click on the small triangle at the
right-hand end of the label box to reveal the popup menu, then select
"Save track data".
