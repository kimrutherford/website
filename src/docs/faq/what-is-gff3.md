# What is GFF3?
<!-- pombase_categories: Data submission and formats -->

Generic Feature Format Version 3 (GFF3) is a tab-delimited text file
format used to represent genomic sequence features.

PomBase produces GFF3 [files of *S. pombe* sequence features](ftp://ftp.pombase.org/pombe/genome_sequence_and_features/gff3/),
and accepts high-throughput data submissions in this format.

The [file format specification](https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/Specifications/blob/master/gff3.md) is
available from the [Sequence Ontology](http://www.sequenceontology.org/) GitHub site. 
Validation tools are available from various online providers.
