# Can I share my search results?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data, Community -->

Yes. In the advanced search, each results page has a stable, unique
URL that you can bookmark, copy/paste, and share. Anyone who follows a
shared link will see the same results page, and the query will be
added to their query history.

The "Visualise" and "Slim" options also generate stable, unique,
sharable URLs, and QuiLT visualisations have the stable URLs no matter
how you reach the QuiLT page.
