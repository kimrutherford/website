# Can I find replication origins in ${database_name}?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data -->

Replication origins cannot yet be viewed or searched as features on
${database_name} pages, but they can be displayed on tracks in the genome
browser. Select one or more of the tracks with data type "Replication
Origins" (see the
[browser track FAQ](/faq/how-can-i-show-or-hide-tracks-genome-browser) 
if necessary).

%%if db=PomBase
You can also use the data collated by Conrad Nieduszynski in
