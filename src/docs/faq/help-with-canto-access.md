# Help! Canto isn't working for me. Do you have any suggestions?
<!-- pombase_categories: Data submission and formats,Tools and resources -->


We have received occasional reports of problems with access to
[Canto](http://curation.pombase.org/pombe), apparently due to firewall
issues, especially from users in China. If you have any trouble, we
have some suggestions relayed from affected colleagues:

   - Some browsers work better than others. Users in China report
     better success with the "360" browser than with Microsoft IE or
     Edge (note that ${database_name} staff have not tested all of these
     browsers ourselves).
   - With any browser, connecting via a VPN may help.
   - When you follow the curation link in an invitation email, it may
     help to refresh the page or click on the "PMID:nnn summary" link
     in the upper left corner of the page before clicking the "Start
     curating" button.
   - A "hard refresh" may help on any Canto page (usually Shift plus
     the usual page-reload keystroke; consult your browser's
     documentation or help).

If none of these solve your problems, or if you have any other
suggestions, please contact the [${database_name}
helpdesk](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org).
