# Why are pombelist messages delayed? Why don't I get pombelist emails promptly?
<!-- pombase_categories: Community -->

One way this can happen is if you have "digest" mode enabled -- this
setting groups messages together and only sends them when a certain
number have accumulated or a certain amount of time has
elapsed. Typically members using digest mode receive messages about
once a day.

To disable digest mode, or just check whether you have it on, go to
the list management page:

https://lists.cam.ac.uk/sympa/info/ucam-pombelist

Log in (upper right corner), then go to "Subscriber Options" in the
left-hand menu. In the "Receiving mode" pulldown. Choose "standard
(direct reception)". Click the "Apply modifications" button (below the
next pulldown), and you can then log out.
