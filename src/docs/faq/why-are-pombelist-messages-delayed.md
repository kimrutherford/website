# Why are pombelist messages delayed? Why don't I get pombelist emails promptly?
<!-- pombase_categories: Community -->

One way this can happen is if you have "digest" mode enabled -- this
setting groups messages together and only sends them when a certain
number have accumulated or a certain amount of time has
elapsed. Typically members using digest mode receive messages about
once a day.

To disable digest mode, or just check whether you have it on, go to
the list management page:

https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/ucam-pombelist

At the bottom of the page, enter your email address and click the
"Unsubscribe or edit options" button. Log in if necessary, then find
the "Set Digest Mode" option, and set it to "Off".
