### Experimental protein structures from PDB on gene pages
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: protein-structure.png -->

The experimental protein structures from
[PDB](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/) are now embedded on the JaponicusDB
gene pages and publication pages using [Mol*](https://molstar.org/).

Currently there are three *S. japonicus* genes with structures in PDB:
  - [mis16/SJAG_03867 gene page](/gene/SJAG_03867)
  - [hhf2/SJAG_03542 gene page](/gene/SJAG_03542)
  - [tyw1/SJAG_04265 gene page](/gene/SJAG_04265)

This list is available from the "Commonly used queries" sub-menu in
the [Advanced search](/query)

From two publications:
  - [Mis16 Independently Recognizes Histone H4 and the CENP-ACnp1-Specific Chaperone Scm3sp](/reference/PMID:26343758)
  - [Biochemical and structural characterization of the flavodoxin-like domain of the Schizosaccharomyces japonicus putative tRNA Phe 4-demethylwyosine synthase Tyw1 in complex with FMN](/reference/PMID:35693892)
