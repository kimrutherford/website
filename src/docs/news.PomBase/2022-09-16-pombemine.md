### PombeMine: an InterMine instance for *S. pombe*
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: intermine.png -->

As part of an Elixir funded collaboration with the
[InterMine team](http://intermine.org/) we have created
[PombeMine](https://www.pombase.org/im/pombemine).  Gene lists can be
sent directly from PomBase query results pages directly to Intermine
(under the “export” tab), providing direct (2 click) access to GO and
phenotype enrichment tools.
