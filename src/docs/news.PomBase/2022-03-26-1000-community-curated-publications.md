We would like to extend a huge "thank you" to the fission yeast
community for curation contributions. The community have now curated
1008 publications providing 70,000 independent annotations, representing
25% of the curation from small-scale publications. In addition, another
80,000 annotations have been provided via the submission of HTP
datasets.

Please contact us
[via the helpdesk](mailto:${helpdesk_address}?subject=New manuscript for curation)
if you would like to provide curation for your manuscript but don't
know how.
