### esyN network visualizations in PomBase

PomBase has implemented network visualisations for fission yeast in
[esyN](http://www.esyn.org/), using data curated by BioGRID and PomBase.
esyN is a web-based tool for building, sharing, and viewing network data
developed by Dan Bean and Giorgio Favrin in the [Cambridge Systems
Biology Centre](http://www.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk), University of Cambridge,
UK.\

On gene pages, we have links to gene-specific interaction networks in
esyN in the table headers of the Interactions sections:

-   The Genetic Interactions section links to all interactions centred
    on the gene and curated in BioGRID
-   The Physical interactions section has links to two datasets:
    -   All physical interactions curated in BioGRID for the gene
    -   Interactions for the gene in the PomBase [High Confidence
        Physical Interaction Network
        (HCPIN)](/documentation/high-confidence-physical-interaction-network)

We also have esyN links on the [GO Slim
page](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-bp-go-slim-terms) and on ontology term
pages for GO Slim biological process terms. Each GO Slim term links to
the HCPIN physical interaction network in esyN (for example, see the
"regulation of mitotic cell cycle"
[network](http://www.esyn.org//builder.php?type=Graph&term=GO:0007346&interactionType=physical&source=pombase&includeInteractors=false)).
