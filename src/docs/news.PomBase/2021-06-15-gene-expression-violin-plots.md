### Violin plots for gene expression
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: advanced_search.png -->

The "Quantitative gene expression" section of PomBase gene pages now
offers a display of [violin
plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot) to visualize where
the gene appears in available expression datasets.

Violin plots are also available to visualize sets of up to 150 genes
in the advanced search results.

At present data from [Marguerat S *et al.*
(2012)](https://www.pombase.org/reference/PMID:23101633) and [Carpy A
*et al.* (2014)](https://www.pombase.org/reference/PMID:24763107) are
included.
