### RNA central and PomBase
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: rna_central_icon.png -->

RNAcentral is a comprehensive database of non-coding RNA
sequences. PomBase is an RNAcentral Consortium member, and all of the
curated non-coding RNAs from PomBase will be available in RNAcentral
soon.  For more information, see their recent [NAR Database Issue paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky1034), as well as current
[search results for *S. pombe* RNAs](https://rnacentral.org/search?q=pombe).
