### PomBase data update

We have updated the data available on the PomBase web site. The data now
includes manual curation through April 28, 2014. Transcriptome data from
[Margeurat *et al* (2012)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23101633)
is now available as Ensembl Browser tracks.

Thank you to all who have done, or are doing, paper curation in Canto.
Over 159 community-curated papers are now included in PomBase.

There are a number of routes to accelerate your data into PomBase,
(either through community curation, or by supplying HTP sequence,
modification or phenotype data in one of our specified formats), see
<http://www.pombase.org/submit-data> for more details.

As usual, please don't hesitate to alert us of any other problems with
data or site performance, or if you have any questions.

Sincerely yours,\
The PomBase Staff
