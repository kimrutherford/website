We have revised the curated 5â€™UTRs using Transcription Start Sites (TSS) data
(in vegetative growth/ minimal media) from the Cap Analysis of Gene Expression
(CAGE) data provided by [Thodberg *et al*](/reference/PMID:30566651). All new
gene structures were manually reviewed, around ~80 protein features had
N-terminal coordinate revisions to align with TSS data.
