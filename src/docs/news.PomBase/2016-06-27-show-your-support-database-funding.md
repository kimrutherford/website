### Show your support for database funding

In response to planned cuts to database funding, leading model organism
researchers have prepared an open letter to NIH Director Dr. Francis
Collins to demonstrate support for the independent community-focused
databases that are essential to their work. Although PomBase is not
directly funded by NIH, we collaborate extensively with those that are,
including the GO Consortium and several model organism databases.\

Please sign the letter to add your voice in support of the databases
that help make your research possible. For more information, we
recommend an email that Mike Cherry sent to the GO-Friends mailing list,
