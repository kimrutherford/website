### New compact GO annotation display

To make the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations easier to read on PomBase
gene pages, we have introduced a new, streamlined display that presents
just the essentials. The summary shows the term name (hyperlinked to the
ontology term page), the count of genes annotated to the term, and any
annotation extensions. All of the previously visible annotation details
are still available -- simply click the "Summary" button to switch to
the "Full" view. Or click the "+" and "-" icons to expand or collapse
the annotation to a single term.\
Â \
In addition, the top of the Biological Process table now lists any GO
slim terms applicable to the gene.
