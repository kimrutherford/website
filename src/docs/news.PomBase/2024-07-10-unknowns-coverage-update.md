### "Unknowns" coverage update

In our 2019 work,
["Hidden in plain sight: What Remains to be discovered in the eukaryotic proteome?"](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsob.180241),
we demonstrated that *S. pombe* had a higher GO biological process (BP)
annotation coverage (86.7%) than both *S. cerevisiae* (83.5%) and human
(82.8%). 

Of the model eukaryotes S. pombe has:

  1. The highest percentage known coverage
  2. The fewest phylum-specific proteins
  3. The smallest proteome (despite a higher number of genes conserved in
     metazoa than S. cerevisiae)
  4. Dedicated efforts to uncover unknown functions

and is uniquely positioned to be the first eukaryote for which we know
the process or pathway for every protein

The trend we identified continues to hold (*S. pombe* “knowns” have
increased to 86.9% in 2024). The coverage is confirmed by the
[Rhee lab GO overview](https://genomeannotation.rheelab.org/#!/overview):
