The fission yeast 2024 database update "PomBase: a Global Core Biodata
Resourceâ€”growth, collaboration, and sustainability" has been
[published in *Genetics*](https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyae007).
This update describes PomBase's continuing growth and improvement over
the past two years and showcases the depth of existing connections both
within the biocuration ecosystem and between PomBase and its user
community.

We discuss ways to track knowledge coverage including the tracking of
unknown proteins, and the use of slimsets. We describe how we provide
value by data and software sharing and how we have reused software
provided by others in our new views. We provide author-led curation
updates, describe contributions to global standards, future plans to
support machine learning with high quality curated data and more.
