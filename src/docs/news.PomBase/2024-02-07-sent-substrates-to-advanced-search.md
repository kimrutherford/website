### Access target genes of individual gene products
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->

It is now possible to send lists of annotated molecular function
substrates to the advanced search from gene pages:

Lists of annotated molecular function substrates of individual genes
(i.e protein kinase or transcription factor target genes) can now be
sent directly to the Advanced Search.  You can send complete lists, or
pre-filtered by cell cycle phase.
