### GeneDB S. pombe decommissioned

As of 14 May 2013, the old GeneDB database for *S. pombe* is no longer
available. This resource consisted of static web pages, was not updated
after March 2012, and not supported by an underlying relational
database. The PomBase site fully supersedes GeneDB *S. pombe*, and
provides improved infrastructure that will meet the current and future
needs of the fission yeast community. Please e-mail the
[helpdesk](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org) if you cannot find a replacement
for any GeneDB functionality in PomBase.
