### PomBase data update 2013-10-21

The PomBase web site has been updated and now includes manually curated
data through October 6, 2013. The number of community-curated papers
continues to increase, ensuring that PomBase gene pages contain complete
and up-to-date information. We are also pleased to announce that data
tracks are now available in the genome browser for data from these two
publications:
