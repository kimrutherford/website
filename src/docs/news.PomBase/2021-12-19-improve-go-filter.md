### Improved options for filtering annotations by cell cycle phase
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: pombase-logo-32x32px.png -->

We have migrated the Gene Ontology annotation filter for "during" a
specific cell cycle phase from the "Summary" view to the "Details"
view to make it more visible. We have also added additional phases to
cover all annotation, and added some useful grouping terms. This
filter is "ontology aware" (so a search on interphase will also
display G1/S/G2 phase annotation). This filter is very useful on pages
like cdc2 that display increasing volume of phase-specific curation.
The revised phase filter options are also available in the gene
expression section.

The filters can be found at the top right of GO annotation sections:
