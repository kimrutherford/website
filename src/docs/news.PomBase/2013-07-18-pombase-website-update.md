### PomBase website update

We'd like to highlight a few improvements we've just made to the PomBase
website. Most of the changes affect the gene pages:

-   The basic information display at the top of each gene page is more
    compact.
-   For ontology annotations, the number of genes annotated is now
    shown, in a column labeled "Count" (also, changes behind the scenes
    involving this data mean that pages should load faster).
-   Annotation extensions for GO are displayed using human-friendly text
    instead of internal "relation" labels.
-   The Quick Links box can now be collapsed and expanded by clicking
    its header.
-   Display of modification annotations using PSI-MOD is improved.

In addition, the Motif Search output now includes standard gene names
and product descriptions. As we noted in a separate message, CDS
coordinate files are once again available from the Downloads, with
accurate and up-to-date data.\
