### New "Target Of" gene page section

With the October 2013 update, gene pages now include "[Target
Of](/documentation/gene-page-target)" annotations, which describe genes
that affect the gene of interest. These annotations are essentially the
reciprocal of [ontology annotation
extensions](/faqs/what-annotation-extension). Each "Target Of"
annotation includes a relationship that indicates how the genes are
connected, the name and product of the second gene, and a reference.
Genes listed under "Target Of" may include upstream regulators or
enzymes that modify the product of the gene of interest. For example,
the "Target Of" annotations for
[cdc2](/spombe/result/SPBC11B10.09#recipext) indicate that it is a
substrate of, and regulated by, the kinase Wee1 and the phosphatase
Cdc25 (among others). At present, "Target Of" data includes annotations
derived from [GO annotation
extensions](/documentation/gene-page-gene-ontology#ann_ext). We will
soon extend it to include data from
[phenotype](/documentation/gene-page-phenotypes) annotation extensions.
