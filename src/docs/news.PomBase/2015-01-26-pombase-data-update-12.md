### PomBase data update

We have updated the data available on the PomBase web site to include
manual curation through January 12, 2015, including 240
community-curated publications. The gene page Phenotype section now
features a compact default display. A downloadable "viability summary"
data file is now available. The PomBase BLAST server has incorporated
interface changes made Ensembl-wide.
