<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: pombase-logo-32x32px.png -->

You can now query the RNA length of genes (spliced or unspliced)
under the "Transcripts and exons" query grouping in the
[Advanced search](https://www.pombase.org/query).

You can also add RNA sequence length as a field in tables downloaded
from the query builder.
