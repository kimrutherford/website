<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->

We have added 77 new disease-gene associations for 71 fission yeast
human gene orthologs.  These were identified using "PombeMine" to
identify the disease genes curated by OMIM not annotated with an
existing MONDO mapping.  The number of human disease gene associations
is currently 1471.  Disease genes can be browsed via the
[disease slim set](/browse-curation/disease-slim) or from the
[MONDO root node term](/term/MONDO:0000001).
