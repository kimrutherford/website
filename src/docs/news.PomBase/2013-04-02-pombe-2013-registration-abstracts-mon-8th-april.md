          Dear Pombe Afficionados,
          Only three weeks left to register and submit abstracts for Pombe 2013, by Monday 8th April: http://events.embo.org/13-pombe
          Speakers for 10 plenary talks and all workshop talks will be selected from abstracts, and there will be attractive poster prizes.
          Payment is only requested after registration, by 10th May.
          Important: if you require accommodation, please do book this real soon now. Especially the most cost-effective student accommodation (comfortable, with private bathrooms) may not be available much longer, as it will be put on general sale shortly. Both hotels and student accommodation will sell out in June, so you have to arrange it now. Information on accommodation is available here: http://events.embo.org/13-pombe/application.html
          We will provide a number of free registrations for which you can apply during online registration (a few of which are reserved for student members of The Genetics Society: you become eligible if you join them now). The meeting is also supported by the Biochemical Society, so if you are, or become, a member you can apply to them for student bursaries or, if you have been a member for at least 1 year, also for travel grants.
          We highly appreciate all the generous contributions from our sponsors so far:
          Platinum: EMBO
          Gold: Biochemical Society, Genetics Society, Formedium, Sunrise Science Products, Singer Instruments, F1000Research, PomBase/Wellcome Trust
          Silver: MDPI - Open Access Publishing, Hybrigenics, Infors, Life Technologies, Bioneer
          Bronze: Nature Communications, m2p labs, Imsol, Open Biology
          We look very much forward to welcoming you in London this June!
          All the best,
          -Jürg & Jacky
