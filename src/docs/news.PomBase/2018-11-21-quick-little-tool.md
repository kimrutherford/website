### See your genes in a QuiLT
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: QLT.png -->

PomBase now offers a new way to display gene lists graphically based
on multiple orthogonal annotation types &mdash; the Quick Little Tool
(QuiLT) for visualisation.

Inspired by our recent analysis of conserved unstudied proteins (see
figures 4 and S1 in the [manuscript at bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/16/469569)), 
QuiLT allows you to create a similar figure for any gene list you
create or import using the advanced search. To use QuiLT, follow the
link to your search results, then click the "Visualise" button. QuiLT
visualisation is also available from the PomBase pages that list genes
annotated to an ontology term, and on the Priority unstudied genes
page.

To see the Unknowns dataset in QuiLT, visit the [unknowns results page](results/from/predefined/priority-unstudied-genes:conserved_unknown)
and click "Visualise".

The QuiLT display is interactive, and you can:

- Highlight subsets of the list, and filter the display
- Toggle annotation types on and off
- Reorder the list to focus on features of most interest
- Download the image

See the [QuiLT documentation](documentation/quick-little-tool)
for more information, and [contact the curators](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org)
if you have comments, questions or suggestions.

Many thanks to our star (and only) programmer, Kim Rutherford, for
developing QuiLT.
