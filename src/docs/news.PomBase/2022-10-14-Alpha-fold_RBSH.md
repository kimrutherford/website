We collaborated with the Pfam group at the EBI to evaluate predictions generated from AlphaFold 
reciprocal best structure hits to identify potential distant orthologs. The RBSH approach provided 
11 novel human homologues, including **Pho86 -> NAT8** (ER acetyltransferase), **Mug174 -> COIL** (Coilin), 
**Ach1 -> OXCT1** (succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid coenzyme A transferase), **SPAC1952.08c -> CREG1**, **imt1 -> A4GALT** 
(Lactosylceramide 4-alpha-galactosyltransferase), **Rtc5 -> MEAK7** (MTOR associated protein). 
A further 41 novel orthologs were predicted between *S. pombe* and *S. cerevisiae* which had fallen under 
the radar for all other methods used at PomBase. Most of the novel connections provided additional 
functional information, or supported existing knowledge for poorly characterised proteins. See supporting 
data tables S4 and S5 for the complete list of predictions included in PomBase.
