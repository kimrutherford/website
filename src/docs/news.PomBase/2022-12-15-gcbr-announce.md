### Global Core Biodata Resource status for PomBase
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: gbc-news-icon.png -->

We are very pleased to announce that PomBase has been selected as one of
the first [Global Core Biodata Resource (GCBR)](https://globalbiodata.org/scientific-activities/global-core-biodata-resources) —
a collection of 37 resources whose long term funding and
sustainability is critical to life science and biomedical research
worldwide. This accreditation recognizes PomBase as a primary
knowledge base (adding value to data through expert curation) and as a
crucial component of the research ecosystem. The candidate biodata
resources were assessed against a series of rigorous criteria that
included their scientific focus, the size and reach of their user
communities, their quality of service, their governance, and their
impact on global research.

Thank you to the entire community, especially the community curators
who contribute regularly to our content, and our
[Scientific Advisory Board](/about/pombase-sab) for their help and
support.
