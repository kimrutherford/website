### Replication origin data loaded into JBrowse
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: browser.png -->

We have loaded data from: [Segurado et al. (2003) "A+T-rich islands"](https://www.pombase.org/reference/PMID:14566325), [Hayashi et al. (2007) "Pre-replicative complex localization; early and late firing origins"](https://www.pombase.org/reference/PMID:17304213), and [Mickle et al. (2007) "Replication origins with functional classification"](https://www.pombase.org/reference/PMID:18093330).  


To view the tracks, either follow the hyperlinks above to the respective PomBase publication pages, and click on the "view" link after "Datasets from this publication are available in the PomBase JBrowse genome browser", 
or go directly to [the browser](http://www.pombase.org/jbrowse/) and click on the "select tracks" button to find the tracks manually. 

For anyone new to JBrowse we have a [quick start guide](https://www.pombase.org/documentation/JBrowse_quick_start).
