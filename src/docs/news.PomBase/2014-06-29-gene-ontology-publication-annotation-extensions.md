### Gene Ontology publication on annotation extensions

PomBase was an early adopter of [annotation extensions](/documentation/gene-page-gene-ontology#ann_ext), which add
spatial, temporal, or substrate/target details to GO annotations. The GO
Consortium has now published a paper describing its implementation of
annotation extensions, in which PomBase examples and its gene page
display figure prominently:

Gene Ontology annotations using a compositional approach. *BMC
Bioinformatics* 2014, **15**:155.
