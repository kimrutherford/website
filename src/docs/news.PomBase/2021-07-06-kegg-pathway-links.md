### KEGG pathway links
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: kegg3.png -->

PomBase gene pages now have links to pathway entries in the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, as well as links to
gene lists for each linked pathway (example: [2-Oxocarboxylic acid metabolism](https://www.pombase.org/term/KEGG_PW:spo01210)). The KEGG
pathway links are the first entry in a new gene page section,
"Molecular pathway", dedicated to connecting genes in PomBase to
depictions of biochemical and signaling pathways.
