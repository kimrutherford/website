### New diploid genotype & phenotype display
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: pombelist.png -->

PomBase now includes pages for curated diploid genotypes, and displays
phenotypes annotated to them on gene and publication pages. For more
details see the documentation for [phenotype
annotations](documentation/gene-page-phenotypes) and [genotype
pages](documentation/genotype-page).
