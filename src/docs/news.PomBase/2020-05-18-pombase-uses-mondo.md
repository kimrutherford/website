### PomBase adopts MONDO for disease gene curation
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: human disease.png -->

PomBase has switched from the [Disease
Ontology](https://disease-ontology.org/) (DO) to the Monarch
Initiative's [Mondo Disease
Ontology](https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/) (Mondo) for disease
gene curation. Mondo covers the same set of disease descriptions as
DO, but has a richer hierarchical structure that classifies more
specific descriptions into broad categories (e.g. anemia, cancer,
kidney disease) suitable for a disease "slim" term set.

PomBase curators are collaborating with Mondo to improve its disease
classification, especially in areas that will support inferences that
improve fission yeast disease annotation coverage in the new [PomBase
Mondo slim](https://www.pombase.org/browse-curation/disease-slim). The
new disease slim is a work in progress, so if there is a particular
disease grouping that you would find useful, please [let us
know](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org).
