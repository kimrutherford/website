PomBase is the first model organism database (MOD) to be selected as an
[ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org) [Core data resource (CDR)](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/core-data-resources).
We were evaluated across a long list of indicators including
scientific focus and quality, governance, and quality of
service. ELIXIR CDRs are European life science data resources that are
important to biological and biomedical research and long-term
preservation of biological data. This will provide assurance to our
funders and users that PomBase satisfies the many criteria required to
considered a key part of the European bioinformatics infrastructure.
[ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org) is an intergovernmental
organisation that brings together life science resources from across
Europe. The goal of ELIXIR is to coordinate these resources so that
they form a single infrastructure.  ELIXIR includes [22 member countries](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/who-we-are),
bringing together over 240 research organisations.
