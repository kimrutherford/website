We continue to identify distant human orthologs. Four new 1:1 huamn
ortholog connections have been added to PomBase this week:

 - RNase MRP subunit Rmp1 = human NEPRO (family submitted to Pfam)
 - RNase P and RNase MRP subunit Pop23 = human RPP38 (members of thesame Pfam clan)
 - RNase P and RNase MRP subunit Pop8 = human RPP14 (family submitted to Pfam)
 - glutamyl-tRNA amidotransferase complex subunit 3 (Gtf1) = human GATC
   Human NEPRO is relatively uncharacterised but is linked to the disease
   Anauxetic dysplasia 3, and GATC with combined oxidative phosphorylation
   deficiency 42
