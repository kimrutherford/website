### PomBase data update

We have updated the data available on the PomBase web site to include
manual curation through August 8, 2014. Community curation now covers
over 190 papers. Gene pages now include links to the [*S. pombe*
PeptideAtlas](https://db.systemsbiology.net/sbeams/cgi/PeptideAtlas/buildDetails?atlas_build_id=355),
a database of peptides identified in tandem mass spectrometry proteomics
experiments.
