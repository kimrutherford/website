### Hermes transposon insertions in PomBase
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: transposon.png -->

PomBase now hosts transposon integration data from
[Lee et al. 2020](/reference/PMID:32101745). Henry
Levin explains the background and significance of the work:

"Transposon Integration Sequencing is a genome wide method of mapping
sequences that contribute to growth. High throughput sequencing of
transposon integration sites in haploid cells with single insertions
reveals which genes are dispensable. Once propagated, cultures exhibit
a pronounced lack of insertions in genes necessary for growth.  This
method, originally developed to study bacteria is now used to
characterize the genomes of several yeasts including *S. pombe*.  In
earlier work we used the transposon Hermes to identify genes of
*S. pombe* required for growth
([Guo et al., 2013, Genetics, PMID:23893486](/reference/PMID:23893486)).  We
have now applied Hermes and Transposon Integration Sequencing to
identify genes important for the formation of heterochromatin
([Lee et al., 2020, Cell Reports, PMID:32101745](/reference/PMID:32101745)).
Insertion sites from eight independent cultures can be visualized from
PomBase as custom tracks on Jbrowse. Four cultures were of cells with
ura4 silenced by cen1 heterochromatin. The other four cultures were of
a strain without ura4.  By passaging the cultures in 5-FOA we selected
against cells with defects in heterochromatin. Genes that contributed
to the formation of heterochromatin exhibited fewer insertions in
cells with the cen1 copy of ura4 relative to the strain lacking ura4.
To distinguish genes critical for heterochromatin from genes that
contribute to a lesser extent we passaged cultures in 5-FOA for 5
generations and for 80 generations. While viewing these integration
sites can indicate whether genes of interest contribute to
heterochromatin formation you can also examine insertions in the
cultures lacking ura4 to gage whether specific genes or noncoding
sequences make significant contributions to growth. "
