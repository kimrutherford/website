The improved nomenclature guidelines for fission yeast clade genes and alleles
have been [published in Genetics GSA](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/genetics/iyad143/7283026).
This update introduces nomenclature guidelines for noncoding RNA genes,
a significant update to the allele and genotype nomenclature
guidelines originally published in 1987.  We took several steps to
improve machine readability that will benefit the artificial
intelligence/machine learning communities, and our own community
curation program.
