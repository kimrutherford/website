### New ontology slimming options for advanced search results 
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: dropdown_menu.png -->

The PomBase [advanced search](/query) results panel now allows you to
retrieve annotations to any of the fission yeast [GO
slims](documentation/pombase-go-slim-documentation) or the [Mondo
disease slim](https://www.pombase.org/browse-curation/disease-slim)
for genes in the results list. For example, you can query for all
genes involved in a process and slim the resulting list by molecular
function or disease association.
