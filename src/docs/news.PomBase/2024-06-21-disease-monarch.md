### Human disease association changes - Monarch
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: human_disease.png -->

We have changed our major source of human disease associations from
[MalaCards](https://www.malacards.org/) to [Monarch](https://monarchinitiative.org/).

This change has:

 1. Increased the number of fission yeast genes with disease
    associations from 1463 to 1551, made the associations more accurate and
    up to date
 2. Allowed us to automate the inclusion of new disease gene imports
    from Monarch based on our ortholog mappings
 3. Enabled us to add the qualifiers "causal" or "correlated with" (for
    multi-genic disorders) to the disease association (you can see this on
    the gene pages under "show details")

Disease associations in PomBase:

 - [Browse the new disease list](/term/MONDO:0700096)
 - [Overview of disease associations (disease slim)](/browse-curation/disease-slim)

If you have knowledge of a specific disease class or notice any issues with
the ontology you can [report this to Monarch](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/issues/)

The Monarch initiative also host our fission yeast phenotype
associations in their [knowledge graph](https://monarchinitiative.org/).
