The pombe community mailing list, pombelist, has migrated from the
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and is now hosted by EBI. The new
address is <pombelist@ebi.ac.uk> (please note that the old address no
longer works, and will generate an automatic notification including the
new address). The link to
[subscribe](http://listserver.ebi.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/pombelist) has
also been updated, and the entire
[archive](http://listserver.ebi.ac.uk/mailman/private/pombelist/) is
available at the new location.
