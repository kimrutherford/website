### PomBase data update

We have updated the data available on the PomBase web site to include
manual curation throughÂ January 25, 2016.\
The genome browser includes variation data, in tracks under "Variation",
from natural *S. pombe* isolates, published in:\
\
Jeffares DC *et al.* 2015. The genomic and phenotypic diversity of
Schizosaccharomyces pombe. *Nat Genet.* **47(3):** 235-241.
doi:[10.1038/ng.3215](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.3215)
[PMID:25665008](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25665008)

New files are now available from the PomBase FTP site, and are linked
from pages in the Download Datasets area:

-   Non-coding RNA sequence feature coordinates (available via the [Data
    Mappings](/downloads/data-mappings) page);
-   Protein features, such as domains and family assignments (available
    via the [Protein Datasets](/downloads/protein-datasets) page);
-   Protein modification annotations (also in Protein Datasets).

The [New and Removed Genes page](/status/new-and-removed-genes) has been
updated to reflect recent deletions and merges.\
\
Note: Ontology graph views are no longer available in the genome
browser, so links have been removed from the GO, FYPO, and modification
tables on the gene pages. For GO and FYPO, links to external ontology
browsers that offer graphical views are available on the [Ontology Term
pages](/documentation/ontology-term-page).\
