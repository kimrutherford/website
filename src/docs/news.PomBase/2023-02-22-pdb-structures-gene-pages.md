#### Experimental structures from PDB on gene pages
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: protein-structure.png -->

The experimental protein structures from
[PDB](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/) are now embedded on the PomBase
gene pages using [Mol*](https://molstar.org/).  For example:
[lsm7/SPCC285.12 gene page](/gene/SPCC285.12)

If you select the “PDB structures” view on a gene page, experimental
structures will set as your default.  AlphaFold predictions will be
shown for genes where an experimental structure are not available.

We now also display the structures on the associated publication page.
For example: [PMID:31010807 Garg *et al.*](/reference/PMID:31010807)

To help locate proteins with experimental protein structures (currently
375), we have added a new query option to the
“[Advanced search](/query)", currently under “commonly used
queries”: "[Proteins with PDB structures](/results/from/id/6e8401aa-bab8-48fc-bbb7-c85d13ea10a2)"
