### PomBase data update 2014-07-17

We have updated the data available on the PomBase web site to include
manual curation through July 8, 2014. The gene pages also now display
protein modification data from an additional large-scale dataset:

Koch A, Krug K, Pengelley S, Macek B, Hauf S. 2011. Mitotic substrates
of the kinase aurora with roles in chromatin regulation identified
through quantitative phosphoproteomics of fission yeast. *Sci Signal*.
**4**(179): rs6 doi: 10.1126/scisignal.2001588
[PMID:21712547](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21712547)\
\
We have also made corrections to some residue positions affected by
sequence updates in one of the modification datasets we added last
month:

Carpy A, Krug K, Graf S, Koch A, Popic S, Hauf S, Macek B. 2014.
Absolute proteome and phosphoproteome dynamics during the cell cycle of
fission yeast. *Mol Cell Proteomics*. 2014 Apr 23. \[Epub ahead of
