### PomBase data update 2013-06-20

PomBase data now includes manual curation through June 9, 2013, and
represents complete annotation for 664 publications (as well as partial
curation of many more). A highlight of this month's literature curation
update is the addition of over 9400 phenotype annotations, representing
about 95% of the phenotype data from the recently published genome-wide
study of cell cycle and cell morphology ([Hayles *et al.* Open Biology
May
2013](http://rsob.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/5/130053.abstract);
[PMID:23697806](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23697806)). We
have also improved the display of allele details for phenotype
annotations. Other changes include better support for gene synonyms in
the simple search, regular updates to the UTR data files, and a number
of minor adjustments to external links in the annotation data tables and
the external references section.
