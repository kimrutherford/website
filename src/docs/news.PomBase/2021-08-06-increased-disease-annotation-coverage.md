### Improved gene-disease curation: over 1400 S. pombe genes
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: human disease.png -->

PomBase disease gene curation associates disease descriptors with
fission yeast orthologs of human disease-causing genes. We have added
new gene&ndash;disease term connections, to bring the total to 1401
*S. pombe* genes. Disease associations now cover 27.3% of all fission
yeast protein-coding genes, and almost 40% with human orthologs.
