### Query phenotypes for conditions

<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: advanced_search.png -->

The PomBase advanced search [Advanced search](/query) now supports
using experimental conditions as search criteria for phenotype
annotations. For example, you can now query for genes that show
abnormal chromosome segregation mutant phenotypes specifically at high
or low temperatures. The search uses the same condition descriptors as
Canto and the PomBase web pages.

Note that phenotype queries that have condition constraints can be
combined, but pay careful attention to the annotations for the
results. Future work will add support for querying for multiple
conditions on the same annotation, and for specifying conditions to
exclude from results.
