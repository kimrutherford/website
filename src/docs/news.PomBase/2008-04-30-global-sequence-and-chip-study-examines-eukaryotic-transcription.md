### Global sequence and chip study examines eukaryotic transcription

Dynamic repertoire of the fission yeast transcriptome reveals: 94% of
the genome is transcribed; extensive variation in different stages and
conditions; global and condition-specific coupling between splicing
efficiency and transcription; confirms the majority of introns; refines
\~75 gene structures; identifies 453 new transcripts 26 of which were
predicted to code for proteins.
