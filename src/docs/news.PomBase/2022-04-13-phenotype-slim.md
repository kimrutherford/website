### New phenotype slim
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: pombase-logo-32x32px.png -->

We have added a [phenotype slim overview](/browse-curation/fypo-slim)
to complement those provided
for [disease association](/browse-curation/disease-slim),
[biological process](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-bp-go-slim-terms),
[molecular function](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-mf-go-slim-terms)
and [cellular component](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-cc-go-slim-terms) annotation.
The purpose of the phenotype slim is to provide
subsets of commonly used 'broad' phenotypic classes or annotation
subsets that can provide a useful starting point for accessing
phenotype lists.  The phenotype slim page provides links to ontology
term pages, annotated genes, and to download files containing the slim
terms and IDs.

The phenotype slim has also been
added to the PomBase [advanced search](/query)
results panel "Slim with" menu.  For example, you can query
for all genes involved in a GO process, another phenotype, or any
other list, and "slim" the results using the "Phenotype slim" option
to view categories of phenotypes assigned to the list.
