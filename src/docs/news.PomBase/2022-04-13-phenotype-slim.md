### New phenotype slim
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: pombase-logo-32x32px.png -->

We have added a [phenotype slim overview](/browse-curation/fypo-slim)
to complement those provided
for disease biological process, molecular function and cellular
component annotation.  The purpose of the phenotype slim is to provide
subsets of commonly used 'broad' phenotypic classes or annotation
subsets that can provide a useful starting point for accessing
phenotype lists.  The phenotype slim page provides links to ontology
term pages, annotated genes, and to download files containing the slim
terms and IDs.
