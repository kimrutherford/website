We have added an additional 5775 novel curated lncRNAs from
[Atkinson *et al*.](https://www.pombase.org/reference/PMID:29914874) to
PomBase.  We will refine the descriptions of these gene products to
align with Sequence Ontology (SO) terms describing RNA features in the
coming months.

Thanks to María Rodríguez-López for preparing the files.
