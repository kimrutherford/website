The phenotype slim option has also been added to the PomBase advanced
search results panel "Slim with" option.  For example, you can query
for all genes involved in a GO process, another phenotype, or any
other list, and "slim" the results using the "Phenotype slim option"
to view categories of phenotypes assigned to the list.
