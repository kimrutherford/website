The [phenotype slim](/browse-curation/fypo-slim) has also been
added to the PomBase [advanced search](/query)
results panel "Slim with" menu.  For example, you can query
for all genes involved in a GO process, another phenotype, or any
other list, and "slim" the results using the "Phenotype slim" option
to view categories of phenotypes assigned to the list.
