## Gene page: Transcript

The Transcript section of a gene page shows the positions of introns
and exons in each transcript. The default is a graphical view:

![Transcript section (default)](assets/gene_page_transcript.png){width="800"}

The default view shows one diagram per annotated transcript, with
intron and exon positions hidden. Click "Show exon/intron/UTR
positions" to display a table under each transcript diagram:

![Transcript section (expanded)](assets/gene_page_transcript_coord.png){width="800"}

1. ID(s) and genomic location(s). The transcript systematic ID is the
   gene systematic ID with a suffix appended. The primary transcript
   suffix is ".1", and any annotated alternative transcripts receive
   sequentially numbered suffixes.

2. By default, intron and exon positions are shown in the
   table as genomic coordinates. When the "Show transcript
   coordinates" button is checked, positions in the table are numbered
   using the annotated transcription start site as 1.

3. Mouse over any exon or intron to highlight its coordinates in the
   table, and bring up a box with position details. Genomic
   coordinates and within-transcript positions appear in the pop-up no
   matter which is selected in the main display.

4. Mouse over any entry in the exon/intron tables to show the box with
   position details.
