## Publication pages

For each publication loaded into PomBase, a page summarizes essential
details about paper, and shows any annotations that cite it.

1.  Publication details, including links to
    [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) and
    [EuropePMC](http://europepmc.org/)
2.  Any community curators who have contributed annotations via Canto
    are acknowledged.
3.  Summary views are identical to those on [gene pages (GO example)](/documentation/gene-page-gene-ontology).
4.  In detailed views annotations are displayed as on [gene pages](/documentation/gene-page-gene-ontology), 
    except that a column for the annotated gene is included and the
    Reference column is omitted.

5.  Term and evidence filtering are available for phenotype
    annotations as described in the [gene page documentation](documentation/gene-page-phenotypes).

Like gene pages, publication pages include annotations of all types,
with summary and detailed views available for most types:
