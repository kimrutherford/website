## Quick Little Tool

${database_name}'s Quick Little Tool (QuiLT) allows you to view multiple types
of annotation for genes in a list in a single graphical display.

### Finding QuiLT

On any gene list page, including Advanced Search results and the gene
lists linked to ontology term pages, click the "Visualise" button to
reach QuiLT. To return to the previous page, use the "Finish
visualisation" button.

### Adding and sorting annotations

In the QuiLT display, each row represents a single gene, and each
column is an annotation type.

Use the checkboxes (1) to toggle an annotation type on and off. When
annotations are shown, a link appears to sort on that annotation
type. You may want to try different combinations of which types are
shown, and which used to sort the list, until you get a display you
like. You can download the graph (with key) in SVG format at any time
(2). The key (4) shows only terms used to annotate genes in the list,
so for small gene lists not all terms may appear.

Click on a row to select a single gene, or click on a box in any
column (3) to select all genes in it. In the displayed gene list, you
can clear the selection (5) or use the "Filter" button (6) to create a
new gene list from the selection (which you can then visualise in
QuiLT).

### Sharing results

Each QuiLT visualisation page has a stable, unique URL that you can
bookmark, copy/paste, and share. Anyone who follows a shared link will
see QuiLT displaying the same gene list. Clicking the "Advanced
Search" button adds a query that would produce the gene list to the
query history.

### Available annotation types

At present, QuiLT includes:

%%if db=PomBase

#### GO annotation precedence

In each branch of GO, only one term per gene can be included for
display. If a gene is annotated to more than one GO term, one is
selected for the QuiLT display according to a set order of precedence:

 * GO biological process
     - signaling (GO:0023052)
     - gene expression (GO:0010467)
