## Gene page: Target of

The "Target of" section describes genes that affect the gene of
interest. Genes listed under "Target of" may include upstream
regulators or enzymes that modify the product of the gene of
interest. For example, the "Target of" annotations for *S. pombe*
[cdc2](/gene/SPBC11B10.09) indicate that it is a substrate of, and
regulated by, the kinase Wee1 and the phosphatase Cdc25 (among
others).

Target of data are derived by taking the reciprocal of [ontology
annotation
extensions](/faq/what-annotation-extension)
(using [GO annotation extensions](documentation/gene-page-gene-ontology#ann_ext) and
[phenotype](/documentation/gene-page-phenotypes) annotation
extensions). The table includes:

-   Ontology: GO or FYPO, i.e. the ontology in which the annotation was
    made
-   Relationship: indicates how the genes are connected. The
    relationship is the reciprocal of the relation used in the
    originating annotation extension, as noted in the 
    [Annotation extension relation display documentation](/documentation/annotation-extension-relation-display).
-   Gene: the gene whose product affects the gene of interest.
-   Product: the targeting gene's product description.
-   Reference (hidden in "summary" view): the source of the annotation.
