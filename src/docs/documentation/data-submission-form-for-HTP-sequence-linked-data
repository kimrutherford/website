PomBase welcomes submissions of published HTP sequence-linked data, suitable for viewing in a genome browser. We require [JBrowse compliant](https://www.pombase.org/faq/data-submission-and-formats) data files and associated meta-data descriptions. We have devised a tab-delimited text file format for description of meta-data. 

Include a header line that labels the columns -- use the entry in the Contents column below as the column header text.

Column | Contents | Example | Mandatory? | Multiple entries allowed?

2 | Unique one sentence track label, in the following format:
    1. binding protein (only for chromatin binding)
    2. datatype
    3. mutant 
    4. during
    5. background
    6. any additional experimental detail or assay information
