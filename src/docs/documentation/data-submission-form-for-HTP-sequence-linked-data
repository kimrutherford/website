PomBase welcomes submissions of published HTP sequence-linked data, suitable for viewing in a genome browser. We require [JBrowse compliant](https://www.pombase.org/faq/data-submission-and-formats) data files and associated meta-data descriptions. We have devised a tab-delimited text file format for description of meta-data. 

Include a header line that labels the columns -- use the entry in the Contents column below as the column header text.

Column | Contents | Example | Mandatory? | Multiple entries allowed?
-------|----------|---------|------------|--------------------------
1 | Data type | Transcripts, Chromatin binding, Nucleosome positioning, Poly(A) sites, Replication origins | Yes | No
2 | Unique one sentence track label, in the following format: 1. binding protein (only for chromatin binding) 2. datatype 3. mutant 4. during 5. background 6. any additional experimental detail or assay information 7. strand 8. ref - first author (year) | Nucleosome positioning during vegetative growth; repeat 1 - Gonzalez et al. (2016), Poly(A) sites during meiosis (forward strand) - Schlackow et al. (2013), Replication origins in cells synchronized by cdc25-ts block/release and hydroxyurea arrest - Xu et al.

3 | Assayed protein | Fkh2 | Only required for chromatin binding data to specify the protein binding to chromatin | No
4 | Experimental background alleles | cdc25-22, leu1-1 | Yes | Yes
5 | WT or mutant (strains with background mutations only are considered WT) | WT | Yes | No
6 | Mutant alleles | clr4-delta, dfp1-3A | No | Yes
7 | Mating type | h90, h+, h- | No | No
