## Gene page: Protein feature widget

This widget shows a visual summary of protein features for the current
gene.  Hover over an allele, partial deletion, modification or Pfam
domain to see more details.  Hover over the track name for a brief
description of the track.

### Available tracks

  - Sequence :: the amino acid sequence - zoom in to see individual residues
  - Mutant positions :: positions where there is a mutation in at least one allele
  - Mutants :: curated alleles (available only in the full view) 
  - Partial deletions :: curated partial deletions
  - Modifications :: Curated modified residues, coloured by modification type
  - Pfam families :: Pfam protein familes from [InterPro](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/)
  - TM domains :: Trans-membrane domains calculated with TMHMM (Krogh et al. 2001)
  - Disordered regions :: Disordered regions from Pfam version 34.0 (El-Gebali et al. 2019)
  - Low complexity :: Low complexity regions from Pfam
  - Coiled coils :: Coiled coils from Pfam

### Mutant display

Single residue alleles are shown as vertical lines (or rectangles if
you zoom in).  Alleles with multiple mutated residues
(eg. "cdc15-E30K,E152K") are shown connected with dashed lines.

### Partial deletions

The solid blue rectangle show the retained amino acids, with dashed
lines for the deletion regions.
