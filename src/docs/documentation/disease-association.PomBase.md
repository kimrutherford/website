## Gene page: Disease associations

The Disease association section lists disease descriptions from the Monarch
Initiative's [Mondo Disease Ontology](https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/) (Mondo) for fission yeast orthologs of human disease-causing genes. 

The summary view shows slim terms (see below) and the names of the most specific terms used to annotate the gene.

The detailed view shows more information for each annotation, and may display additional terms:

![full gene page disease association annotation](assets/gene_page_disease_full.png "Disease associations"){width="800"}

1. [Mondo slim](browse-curation/disease-slim) terms applicable to the
   gene.

2. The Mondo term ID and name, which link to a page with additional
   information, including the term definition, any synonyms,
   relationships to other Mondo terms, and annotations to the term or
   its descendants.

3. Indicates whether the annotation was created by PomBase curators or
   obtained from an external source (usually [Malacards](https://www.malacards.org/)

4. The paper from which the annotation comes.

5. The number of genes annotated to the term, linked to an ontology
   term page as described above.
