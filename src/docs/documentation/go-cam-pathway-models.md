## GO-CAM pathways

GO-CAMs, or Gene Ontology Causal Activity Models, are a framework
within the Gene Ontology (GO) project that aims to represent complex
biological processes in a structured, formal, and computable
manner. GO-CAMs extend the traditional GO annotations by incorporating
causal relationships between activities (e.g., molecular functions)
and linking them to biological processes and cellular components. This
allows for the representation of how gene products interact and
function in a biological context. This involves specifying the
entities (genes, proteins, etc.), their activities, and the causal
relationships between them. GO-CAMs are represented as graphs where
nodes represent molecular activities and edges represent causal
relationships. This graphical representation enables the capture of
complex interactions and pathways.

At PomBase, we have begun representing biological pathways as GO-CAM
models and displaying them on the relevant gene and process pages.
