      "content" : "\n\nGeneral GO Slim hints\n\nThese points will help you understand GO slims, and highlight some features of the fission yeast slim terms and annotations.\n\n1.  Note that the counts in the “Genes” column of the GO slim tables are not additive, because many gene products are annotated to multiple terms.\n2.  It not possible to create a slim with no overlaps between terms. Although the fission yeast slims have been defined to include biologically informative terms, and minimise overlaps between terms, large overlaps cannot be entirely avoided. For example, most of the gene products annotated to signal transduction are also annotated other terms in the slim.\n3.  As a consequence of points 1 and 2, GO slim annotation summaries should not be presented using pie charts. Although a pie chart could show the fraction of total annotations for any slim term, it can too easily be mistaken for the fraction of total annotated gene products, which is not the same.\n4.  It is difficult to define a slim which includes all annotated gene products without including terms with very small numbers of annotations (for example, the peroxisome organization branch has very few annotations), or very high level terms which are not particularly biologically informative (e.g. cellular process). Because we have opted not to include such terms, some gene products are annotated to terms but do not appear in the slim annotation set for each ontology (especially biological process).\n5.  Bear in mind that both proteins and RNAs can be annotated to GO terms. If you are working only with proteins you will need to make adjustments for this. For example, many tRNAs and rRNAs are annotated to cytoplasmic translation, and are therefore included in the slim set.\n6.  There is a difference between “unknown” and “unannotated”. All fission yeast and budding yeast gene products have been assessed and are classed as “unknown” for biological process if no biological process information is found (experimental or inferred). If you are making comparisons with other organisms, remember that it is possible that not all gene products have been assessed and that the “unknown” set is underestimated.\n7.  The default fission yeast slim lists include all evidence codes for fission yeast. The evidence code IEA (inferred from electronic annotation) is often considered to be less accurate than other evidence codes, but it is very useful for increasing the coverage of some of the high level GO terms. Accurate annotation counts for some terms currently depends on including this evidence code (for example, there are 16 gene products annotated to transmembrane transport with IEA evidence, which are not yet covered by a manual annotation). For S. japonicus*, the IEA annotations improve slim coverage, but only represent a small number of annotations, and have a low rate of false positives. We therefore recommend that you include them.\n\nCreating a user-defined slim\n\n1.  You can create your own slim, or retrieve slim annotations for a gene set, using online slimming tools such as the GOTermMapper at Princeton or QuickGO Explore Biology at EBI (note that QuickGO requires UniProtKB accessions; JaponicusDB IDs will not work).\n2.  When creating a slim for the entire genome, you should try to ensure that it covers as many annotated genes in your set as possible (see #3 in the list above). You should be aware of how many genes are annotated but not in your slim, and how many are “unknown” (i.e., annotated only to the root node; see #5 above).\n3.  For display purposes you usually want to keep the number of terms as small as possible to convey your results. However, you should ensure that the terms you include are specific enough to capture biologically relevant information. Many terms (e.g. metabolic process (2931 annotations), cellular process (4149 annotations)) are too general for the purpose of most slim-based analyses.\n4.  On a related note, if you are using your slim for data analysis (e.g. to summarize an enrichment), you should ensure that the terms are specific enough to demonstrate their relevance to the biological topic of interest. For example, lumping all genes involved in transport my mask overrepresentation of transmembrane transport vs. underrepresentation of vesicle-mediated transport in your results set, so you need to ensure that the slim has categories to represent your results effectively.\n5.  Most current implementations of software to create “GO slims” include the regulates relationship by default, so that (for example) genes involved in regulation of cytokinesis will be included with the set of genes annotated to cytokinesis. See the GO Ontology Relations documentation for further information about relationships in GO. The annotation totals presented for the default S. japonicus process slim in JaponicusDB, by contrast, are calculated explicitly including the genes which are involved in a process via regulation only. We expect the distinction to be available in future versions of slimming software.\n",

      "content" : "\n\nNote: This documentation is still a work in progress. Please contact the helpdesk if you have any questions.\n\nThe JaponicusDB advanced search allows you to construct complex queries for S. japonicus genes. At present all advanced search results are lists of genes that match the query specifications. Hints for specific searches are available in the JaponicusDB FAQ, and linked below (scroll down to Search tips).\n\nOverview\n\nIn the Search menu, choose Advanced (or bookmark https://www.japonicusdb.org/query).\n\nIn the Query panel (top), click one of the links in the list on the left to choose a query type (described below). Arrowheads indicate list entries that expand to offer two or more query types, organized in tabs. For each query, the interface guides your input.\n\n[advanced search page with new query]\n\nIn the History panel (bottom), queries are listed in reverse chronological order (most recently run first). Results are linked in the Count column; the link goes to a page that displays the gene name, systematic ID, and product description for matching genes. The Download button offers additional options, including nucleotide and (where applicable) protein sequence. To return to the search page, use the blue “<- ” button just above the result list, not your browser’s “Back” button.\n\nYou can select queries in the list to combine or delete them. To combine queries, you must select two or more from the list, and then click one of the operator buttons:\n\n[advanced search Boolean operator buttons]\n\nResults are added to the history list:\n\n[advanced search query history list]\n\nQueries using the NOT operator default place the more recently run query first (newer NOT/Subtract older):\n\n[advanced search page NOT operator dialog]\n\nClick “Change direction” to switch the order. Click “Submit” to run the query.\n\nYou can also move any query to the top of the history list by clicking its “Results” link, and then clicking the “<- ” button.\n\nQuery results can remain available in the history list for several days. If changes in annotation cause results to change since a query was last run, an additional “Previous” column will be displayed in the history list, showing the out-of-date result count:\n\n[advanced search page with out-of-date query]\n\nClick on the “Results” link to re-run the query and retrieve the up-to-date result.\n\nIf the parameters for a query are not all visible in the history, a “[details]” toggle (1) to show or hide additional details will appear. You can also edit the name that appears in the history list (2). The name will be used as part of the description when the query is used in any combined query (which can, in turn, be given a new name).\n\n[advanced search query name and details]\n\nQuery results page\n\nClicking on any up-to-date count in the “Results” column goes to a page that shows the count, query details, and a list of matching genes.\n\n[advanced search results page]\n\n1.  Return to the main  page (you can also use the browser “back” button)\n\n2.  Click on a header to sort by the column\n\n3.  Select columns to display. A set of gene expression data sets are hidden by default; click “Show gene expression columns” to reveal the additional options.\n\n4.  Click to send the gene list to QuiLT for visualisation.\n\n5.  Show GO slim annotations for genes in the list. Click “Slim with” to reveal a dropdown, and choose a slim. Note: when you return to the main  page, the query history will include an entry showing the query as a gene list. This is harmless.\n\n6.  Narrow the list: click the button to reveal checkboxes. Available for lists of up to 1000 genes.\n\n7.  Download selected data for genes in the list. The popup offers three sets of options:\n\n-  The default “Tab delimited” view offers a set of details that can be included in a downloaded text file. Click “Show gene expression columns” to reveal additional options.\n -  Use the “Sequence” tab to retrieve amino acid or nucleotide sequences in FASTA format. Use the checkboxes to select which items are included in the headers. When “Nucleotide” is selected, flanking sequence options similar to those on the gene page are available.\n -  In the “GO Annotation” tab, you can choose which ontologies to include. Downloaded annotations are in GAF 2.1 format. Note that only “direct”, not inferred, annotations are included, as described in this FAQ.\n\nSharing search results\n\nEach results page has a stable, unique URL that you can bookmark, copy/paste, and share. Anyone who follows a shared link will see the same results page, and the query will be added to their query history.\n\nThe “Visualise” and “Slim” options also generate stable, unique, sharable URLs.\n\nQuery types\n\nOntology queries (GO, phenotype, protein modification, and protein sequence feature) retrieve genes that are annotated to the selected term(s), and to their descendants via specified relations (see the GO documentation on Ontology Structure and Ontology Relations for more information on relationships between terms in ontologies, and see the descriptions below of specific ontology filters for lists of which relations are followed to retrieve annotations). Ontologies can be searched by ID or term name. Type or paste a complete ontology ID, including the prefix (e.g. GO:0005634, FYPO:0002059), or simply start typing to search for a term name. Choose a term from the list of options offered by the autocomplete, and click “Submit”.\n\nNote: Only terms that are used in annotations (direct or inferred by transitivity) will appear as autocomplete suggestions. This is to avoid having irrelevant terms, such as “chloroplast” or “echolocation” appearing. Any term without annotations can be found by searching by its ID, and will appear in the query history with “0” results.\n\nCommonly used queries\n\nThis item offers convenient links to perform frequently used queries easily. Click on the query description to add the results to the query history.\n\nPlease contact the helpdesk if you would like any queries added to the selection.\n\nGene names and IDs\n\nType or paste a list of gene names or systematic IDs (or a mixture), or click the “Browse” button to select a file to upload. Click “Lookup” to add the gene list to the history (useful for combining the list with other queries).\n\nUniProt accessions\n\nLinks to the Identifier Mapper.\n\nGO\n\nThe Gene Ontology (GO) query retrieves gene products annotated to a GO term and to any of its child terms, following the is_a, part_of, regulates, positively_regulates,and negatively_regulates relationships in the ontology. You may also find it helpful to search or browse in QuickGO or AmiGO to find GO terms of interest. If one search does not seem to retrieve as many results as you expect, try again using a less specific term.\n\nPhenotype\n\nThe phenotype (Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology) query retrieves genes annotated to a FYPO term and to any of its child terms, following the is_a, part_of, output_of, has_output, and has_part relationships in the ontology. This query also offers additional context-dependent options. By default, the phenotype search retrieves genes from single-allele haploid and diploid genotypes annotated to the searched FYPO term:\n\n[phenotype default search options]\n\nYou can alter the selected options to add genes from multi-allele genotypes, and/or to search specifically for haploids or diploids. See the gene page phenotype documentation and the genotype page documentation for more information.\n\nIf you select single-locus haploids, expression level options are also available:\n\n[phenotype search options for single-locus haploids]\n\nDifferent alleles of one gene may have different phenotypes, and one allele may give rise to different phenotypes under different experimental conditions. At present, you can retrieve annotations for all alleles of a gene, or use the “Expression level” options restrict the query to null alleles (covers deletions and any other sequence changes, such as most disruptions, that completely abolish expression of the gene) or overexpression of the wild type allele.\n\n[phenotype condition search option]\n\nThe “Constrain condition” option restricts the results to include only genes that have phenotype annotations including the specified condition. The search uses the same condition descriptors as Canto and the JaponicusDB web pages. Start typing, then choose from the autocomplete options.\n\nNote that the results will include any gene that has phenotype annotations including the specified condition for any allele. Queries that include conditions can be combined using the AND, NOT, or OR operators like any other, but the result of any combination of phenotype queries will likely include annotations for different alleles. There may not be any individual annotation in which both/all of multiple conditions co-occur.\n\nThe search does not yet support querying for multiple conditions on the same annotation, nor for queries that exclude a given condition; both are planned for future development.\n\nProduct type\n\nChoose a gene product type (e.g. protein coding, tRNA, etc.) from the pulldown menu.\n\nProtein modification\n\nSearch for terms or IDs in the PSI-MOD ontology.\n\nDomain, features and motifs\n\nQueries for proteins that have a specified domain, sequence feature, or structural feature\n\nDomain ID\n\nSearch for a protein domain using an ID from Pfam, PRINTs, PROFILE, ProSite, or InterPro. Type or paste an accession and click “Submit”.\n\nProtein motifs\n\nThis query searches for terms or IDs in the Sequence Ontology and retrieves protein-coding genes where the protein has the feature represented by the SO term (e.g. KEN box SO:0001807).\n\nTM domains\n\nFind protein-coding genes with products that have a specified number of transmembrane domains. Use the appropriate button for any TM domains or none, or enter the desired minimum and maximum number and click “Search”.\n\nCoiled-coil regions\n\nFind protein-coding genes with products that have a specified number of coiled-coil regions. Use the appropriate button for any coiled-coil regions or none, or enter the desired minimum and maximum number and click “Search”.\n\nDisordered regions\n\nFind protein-coding genes with products that have a specified number of disordered regions. Use the appropriate button for any disordered regions or none, or enter the desired minimum and maximum number and click “Search”.\n\nLow-complexity regions\n\nFind protein-coding genes with products that have a specified number of low-complexity regions. Use the appropriate button for any low-complexity regions or none, or enter the desired minimum and maximum number and click “Search”.\n\nProtein properties\n\nPhysical properties of protein gene products:\n\nProtein length\n\nFind protein-coding genes with products in a specified length range. Enter the desired minimum and maximum length and click “Search”.\n\nProtein mol. weight\n\nFind protein-coding genes with products in a specified mass range. Enter the desired minimum and maximum mass in kiloDaltons (kDa) and click “Search”.\n\nGenome location\n\nFind genes in a specified region of a chromosome. Select a chromosome from the pulldown, and click “Search” to retrieve all genes on the chromosome. Or click the radio button to switch to “Genes overlapping range”, and enter start and end coordinates in the boxes to retrieve only genes in the specified region. Note that genes that partly overlap the entered coordinates will be included.\n\nNumber of exons\n\nFind genes with a specified number of coding exons in the primary transcript (note: at present this query does not consider any annotated alternative transcripts). Enter the desired minimum and maximum number and click “Search”.\n\nNumber of transcripts\n\nFind genes with a specified number of annotated transcript isoforms; Enter the desired minimum and maximum number and click “Search”. (Note: alternative transcripts are only explicitly annotated if functional differences between isoforms are identified- see the browser datasets for the full extent of known transcript variation)\n\nProtein with orthologs\n\nChoose a species from the pulldown menu to retrieve all S. japonicus genes with a curated ortholog in the selected species.\n\nSearch tips\n\nFAQ entries relevant to using the advanced search are organised here by topic. Several of the topics also correspond to gene page sections.\n\nPhenotype searches\n\n-  Can I get a list of essential japonicus genes?\n-  How can I find all of the genes that have a given mutant phenotype?\n-  Why are some genes annotated to both viable and inviable phenotypes?\n-  How can I browse the phenotype ontology (FYPO)?\n\nGene Ontology searches\n\n-  How can I search or browse GO annotations?\n-  How can I find genes with a specific activity?\n-  How can I find protein localization data?\n-  How can I identify all of the genes that affect a process?

      "content" : "\n\nJaponicusDB uses the Gene Ontology (GO) to describe the biological context of genes.\n\nGO consists of three distinct ontologies (or sets of vocabularies) that describe a gene’s:\n\n1.  Molecular Function (MF) — single-step activities such as kinase activity or transporter activity\n2.  Biological Process (BP) — a series of functions with a common goal such as MAPK cascade or cytokinesis\n3.  Cellular component (CC) — the location where the gene product can be found, and what complexes it is part of, for instance nucleus or fatty acid synthase complex\n\nA gene product may be annotated to several GO terms from each of the three ontologies; mcm3, for instance, is annotated to single-stranded DNA helicase activity, ATP binding, and DNA replication origin binding (MFs), it acts in mitotic DNA replication initiation and negatively regulates the MCM helicase activity (BPs), and is found locations including the replication fork and the pre-replicative complex (CC).\n\nEach table includes ontology term details and supporting data. The GO annotation display on JaponicusDB gene pages includes ontology term details and supporting data. The summary view shows just the essentials: The list of terms is filtered, using the ontology structure, so that it shows only the most specific terms used to annotate a genotype, and each unique combination of gene, GO term, and extension(s) is shown once:\n\n[summary gene page GO annotations]\n\n1.  The GO term name, which links to a page with additional information, including the term definition, any synonyms, relationships to other GO terms, and annotations to the term or its descendants. (See the JaponicusDB ontology term page documentation and the GO documentation on the GO graph and Relations in GO for more information.)\n2.  GO Slim terms applicable to the gene.\n3.  GO annotations may have extensions to capture any of several types of additional detail. S. japonicus genes link to JaponicusDB gene pages, and ontology term names link to ontology term pages.\n\nThe detailed view shows annotations to all GO terms, and includes more details for each annotation. It shows separate entries for repeat determinations of a given gene/term/extension combination (if supported by more than one line of evidence and/or reported in more than one paper), and annotations to terms hidden in the summary view:\n\n[full gene page GO annotations]\n\n1.  The unique ID and name for a GO term, linked to an ontology term page as described above.\n\n2.  An abbreviation (code) for the type of (see “Evidence codes” below) that supports the annotation. The evidence categories come from the set of evidence codes defined by the GO Consortium.\n\n3.  An additional ontology term or identifier that provides supporting details for annotations using certain evidence codes (see below and GO documentation).\n\n4.  An optional qualifier that modifies the connection between the gene product and the GO term. Entries come from the set of allowed qualifiers described in GO’s annotation overview or internal JaponicusDB usage.\n\n5.  The paper from which the annotation comes.\n\n6.  The number of genes annotated to the term, linked to an ontology term page as described above.\n\n7.  GO Slim terms applicable to the gene.\n\n8.  GO annotations may have extensions(see “Annotation extensions” below) to capture any of several types of additional detail. S. japonicus genes link to JaponicusDB gene pages. Protein Ontology (PRO) terms, which identify specific processed or modified forms of a protein, can be used in extensions or to indicate which form is active; both are displayed here.\n\nTerm ID and name\n\nAnnotations are made to the definition of a term, not the term name itself, so we recommend that users always read the term definition. The definition is critical because an ontology term name may change over time, but if the meaning of a definition changes the term must be obsoleted, and the associated genes must be reannotated to the correct definition. This procedure makes ontologies very robust to changes in biological knowledge, because if the definition is constant terms can be repositioned in the ontology (i.e. parents terms can be added or removed) without affecting the validity of the annotations that are attached to it.\n\nThe definition of a term can be found on the ontology term page linked to the term name and ID.\n\nGO Structure\n\nGO is structured in a hierarchal order with less specific terms being parents of more specific child terms. A child term may have multiple parents and multiple children; the BP mitotic sister chromatid segregation, for instance, has child terms representing each part of the segregation process (sister chromatid cohesion, separation, etc.) as well as parent terms connecting it to both the mitotic cell cycle and chromosome segregation. Crucially, whenever an annotation is made to a term, the gene product is automatically annotated to all the parent terms. The ancestry of a term can be viewed in browsers such as AmiGO or QuickGO, accessible via links on the ontology term page. For more information, see the GO graph documentation.\n\nMultiple relationships exist to describe the links within the ontologies. A child term can have an is_a relation to the parent term, where the child is a more specific type of the parent, or a part_of relationship where the child makes up a part of the parent. For instance, the mitochondrion is_a intracellular organelle and is part_of a cell. Additionally, GO also include regulatory relationships. For more information on relationships in GO, see the Relations in GO documentation.\n\nEvidence codes\n\nIn JaponicusDB, every annotation is supported by a reference that states where the annotation comes from, and an evidence code that describes the type of data that supports the annotation. An annotation may be inferred from experimental ‘wet lab’ data, backed by a literature reference and citing experimental evidence such as IDA (Inferred from Direct Assay) or IMP (Inferred from Mutant Phenotype). Further information on evidence codes is available in the GO Evidence Codes documentation.\n\nAnother source of annotations come from computational methods. Please note that all computational annotations are based on predictions. In cases where a sequence model has been used to annotate genes, but the genes annotated based on the model have not been manually checked, the IEA (Inferred from Electronic Annotation) evidence code is assigned. If the annotations have been manually checked other evidence codes may be used, for instance ISO (Inferred from Sequence Orthology) or ISM (Inferred from Sequence Model). JaponicusDB uses ISO to cross-reference to the roles of known S. cerevisiae genes, and uses ISM when domains present in a gene product can give clues to its biological role.\n\nFor some types of evidence, such as sequence comparisons or interaction data, it is important to note what gene or gene product was used in the comparison or detected in the interaction. In these cases the With/From column provides more information regarding the source of the information.\n\nAnnotation extensions\n\nWhere available, annotation extensions are displayed underneath the GO term name. The extensions provide additional specificity to the annotation by linking the term to another ontology term or a gene product via a relationship. Examples include specifying substrates of molecular functions or specifying the cellular localization during a process (for instance, S. pombe pka1 has protein serine/threonine kinase activity and has the substrates mei3 and rst2. It is a cellular component of the nucleus during nitrogen starvation, but found in the vacuole during glucose starvation).\n\nThe GO Consortium provides further information on annotation extensions in its file format guide, on a wiki page, and in publications from 2014 and 2017. JaponicusDB converts many extension names to more human-friendly text, as described here.\n\nIf an extension mentions another S. japonicus gene, the extension data will also be displayed as an annotation in the “Target of” section of the page for that gene.\n\nPRO terms can be used in extensions, and PRO terms that are used to associate a GO annotation with a specific modified or processed form are also listed with annotation extensions. In both cases, PRO IDs link to Protein Ontology web pages. Note that JaponicusDB uses human-friendly display names that differ from the full names on the PRO pages; abbreviations used in the display names are included in the extension display documentation.\n\nFinding other genes annotated to a specific GO term\n\nFrom a gene page, all S. japonicus genes annotated to a term (or its children) can be found by clicking on a term name or ID to reach the ontology term page.\n\nAdditionally, the advanced search can be used to search for all genes annotated to a particular GO term (see the advanced search documentation for more information). To find annotations to specific GO terms in organisms other than S. japonicus we recommend using AmiGO or QuickGO.\n",

The extensions provide additional specificity to the annotation, often by linking the term to another ontology term or a gene product via a relationship. Examples include specifying the gene product that adds or removes a modification, specifying modified residues, or specifying that the modification is observed during a phase or process. For example, in S. pombe Lys4 (shown above) is phosphorylated on a serine residue during M phase of the mitotic cell cycle. Likewise, S. pombe Cdc2 is phosphorylated during G2, and phosphorylated on Tyrosine 15 by Wee1; it is phosphorylated during G2 but not M phase of the mitotic cell cycle; other extensions are also available for Cdc2.\n\nThe annotation extension field can also be used to indicate modification site occupancy, for experiments that measure the proportion of copies of the protein (or RNA) that have the modification.\n\nNote: unlike GO annotations, for modification annotations extensions are not considered for display filtering. Annotations to less specific terms are hidden in the summary view whether they have extensions or not.\n",

In JaponicusDB, phenotypes are annotated using terms from the Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO). FYPO uses several existing ontologies from the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) collection to construct formal definitions. Basic documentation for FYPO is available at the OBO Foundry, and further information is available on the FYPO wiki).\n\nIn the phenotype annotation display on JaponicusDB gene pages, the first item shown is a brief summary indicating whether cells with a null (deletion) allele of the gene are viable or inviable, or either depending on experimental conditions. Next, single-locus phenotypes are shown in two tables. The first table lists phenotypes observed at the population level, such as viability in culture, and the second shows cell-level phenotypes. Note that the viable/inviable population terms describe whether a gene is essential or not, and see the wiki FYPO Content and Structure documentation for more information on cell and population phenotypes. Finally, two more tables list population-level and cell-level multi-locus phenotypes, i.e. phenotypes associated with double mutants, triple mutants, etc, and the relevant genotype details. Diploid genotypes are included in the single- or multi-locus tables as appropriate.\n\nEach table includes ontology term details and supporting data.

It is worth reading these definitions, as the language often used in publications does not match the naming of genetic interactions. For example, in publications we can find “double deletion of gene X and Y rescues the defects cellular morphology caused by deletion of gene Y”. However, for BioGRID this is a phenotypic suppression not a rescue, since rescue is reserved for lethality or growth defect. The genetic interactions that are used in low throughput curation in PomBase are:\n\n-  Dosage Growth Defect: Overexpression/increased dosage of one gene causes a growth defect in a strain that is mutated/deleted for another.\n-  Dosage Lethality: Overexpression/increased dosage of one gene causes lethality in a strain that is mutated/deleted for another gene.\n-  Dosage Rescue: Overexpression/increased dosage of one gene rescues the lethality or growth defect of a strain mutated/deleted for another gene.\n-  Phenotypic Enhancement: Mutation/deletion/overexpression of one genes results in enhancement of any phenotype (other than lethality/growth defect) associated with mutation/deletion/overexpression of another gene.\n-  Phenotypic Suppression: Mutation/deletion/overexpression of one gene results in suppression of any phenotype (other than lethality/growth defect) associated with mutation/deletion/overexpression of another gene.\n-  Synthetic Growth Defect: Mutations/deletions in separate genes, each of which alone causes a minimal phenotype, but when combined in the same cell results in a significant growth defect under a given condition.\n-  Synthetic Lethality: Mutations/deletions in separate genes, each of which alone causes a minimal phenotype, but when combined in the same cell results in lethality under a given condition.\n-  Synthetic Rescue: Mutation/deletion of one gene rescues the lethality or growth defect of a strain mutated/deleted for another gene.\n\nBelow is a decision making tree to determine the type of genetic interaction from the phenotypes of the single and double mutant. “Interacting allele” refers to the allele that is not present in the single mutant:\n\n[Decision making for genetic interactions]\n",

This is extremely important to indicate the importance of resources to funders. How to cite JaponicusDB.\n\nTypes of pages in JaponicusDB\n\nJaponicusDB is centred around Gene Pages so this is a good place to begin to familiarise yourself with how data is organised. You should visit your favourite gene page, but for this example we are using pol1, the DNA polymerase alpha catalytic subunit. You can access the page by typing the gene name (i.e. pol1) into the search box at the top-right of the website, or at this link.\n\nAt the top of the page, you will find some basic information about the locus and gene product. Immediately below is a view of the genomic context of the gene in the JBrowse genome browser. (documentation to access browser data tracks is here):\n\n[Top of gene page]\n\nOn the left side of the Gene Page, there is a menu listing the sections in the page (GO molecular function, GO biological process, etc.). Each section contains different kinds of annotations. Go through them and click on the button to see what information is displayed in each section. Most sections show a “summary view” of the experimentally relevant information so that it is easier to consume the biological context. The “Show details” link uncollapses the section to show important associated information such as evidence and provenance, often presenting multiple sources supporting the same annotation. You also will notice that many of the displayed annotations are blue and link to other types of pages:\n\n-  GO term pages: contain the definition of the GO term and lists all the genes annotated to a specific GO term and its “child” terms. Read more… GO annotations link a gene to a GO term that describes the molecular function(s) of its gene products, the process(es) they are involved in their localisation in the cell or their presence in macromolecular complexes. A term name may change over time, but if the meaning of a definition changes the term must be obsoleted, and the associated genes reannotated to the correct definition. This makes the term definition critical and curators must always ensure that the definition is appropriate for the annotation. A GO term can be linked to several parent terms through relationships. Let’s take the term GO:0001055 (RNA polymerase II activity), graph below. RNA polymerase II activity is a GO molecular function. This activity is a specific type of GO:0003899 (DNA-directed 5’-3’ RNA polymerase activity), so GO:0001055 is linked to GO:0003899 through\n an is_a relationship. This activity is part of the GO biological process GO:0006366 (Transcription by RNA polymerase II), so GO:0001055 is linked to GO:0006366 through a part_of relationship. This activity occurs at the GO cellular component GO:0000785 (chromatin) so GO:0001055 is linked to GO:0000785 through a occurs_in relationship. In JaponicusDB GO term pages, for simplicity we do not present inter-ontology links and only link to children and parent terms of the same ‘aspect’ (i.e molecular function, biological process, cellular component) these include terms related to each other by the relationships is_a, part_of and the 3 ‘regulates’ relationships. For instance, in the page of GO molecular function GO:0003899 (DNA-directed 5’-3’ RNA polymerase activity): We include GO:0001055 (RNA polymerase II activity), which is also a GO molecular function, linked to GO:0003899 through an is_a relationship We do not include the cellular component GO:0000428, linked to the molecular\n function GO:0003899 through a capable_of relationship. If you expand a term by clicking on the ‘+’ icon on its left, you can see the relationship to the term in the current page. Learn more about GO, its development and use in analyses in this webinar by former PomBase curator Antonia Lock.\n\n-  Phenotype pages the Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO) term pages: provide the phenotype definition and list all the genotypes annotated to a FYPO term and its ‘child’ terms, as well as link to the parent terms. Read more… Read more… As for GO, the simplest relationship between FYPO terms is is_a, in which the child term describes a more specific phenotype than the parent. For example, FYPO:0006885 (decreased protein level at mitotic spindle) is_a FYPO:0001324 (decreased protein level during vegetative growth), which in turn is_a FYPO:0001325 (altered protein level during vegetative growth). Other relationships also exist, such as output_of, which links a given phenotype to another that causes it. For example, FYPO:0000118 (multiseptate vegetative cell) is output_of FYPO:0000032 (abnormal cytokinesis). Therefore, in the page of FYPO:0000032, the annotations of FYPO:0000118 are also displayed. Read more about FYPO, our phenotype ontology here.\n\n-  Genotype pages: contain all the phenotypes associated with a genotype as well as the alleles that constitute that genotype. Example: mal3delta.\n\n-  Other ontology term pages. Read more\n\nAdvanced search / query builder\n\nYou can query JaponicusDB annotations using a Graphical User Interface, the “Advanced search” (https://www.pombase.org/query). You can make lists of genes that satisfy a certain condition, and perform operations with these lists. Below some examples:\n\n-  Disease-associated genes that give a cytoskeleton phenotype in Schizosaccharomyces japonicus: Read how to make this query… Get the list of all disease-associated genes: Click on Commonly used queries > All disease associated genes. Get the list of all genes annotated with a cytoskeleton phenotype: Click on Phenotype Type “abnormal cytoskeleton” and select FYPO:0002397. Click on Submit You should see two queries in the Combine queries table below named “genes annotated with”abnormal cytoskeleton” […]” and ”All disease associated genes”. Select both by clicking on the tickbox on the left. Then click on intersect / and. This will generate an intersection of both lists (genes present in both) with genes that satisfies both conditions. The number in the “Results” column is the number of genes that satisfy those conditions. Click on it to see the lists of genes. In that page, you can choose the columns to be displayed, and export your data for further usage.\n\n-  Genes that locate to the Golgi apparatus or the endoplasmic reticulum and cause an exocytosis or endocytosis phenotype. Read how to make this query… Get the list of all genes that have annotations saying that one of their gene products locates to the Golgi apparatus (they are annotated to GO:0005794, “Golgi apparatus”): Click on GO Type “Golgi apparatus” and select GO:0005794. Click on Submit Get the list of all genes that have annotations saying that one of their gene products locates to the endoplasmic reticulum (they are annotated to GO:0005783, “endoplasmic reticulum”). Click on GO Type “endoplasmic reticulum” and select GO:0005783. Click on Submit In the Combine queries table below, select both genes annotated with “Golgi apparatus” and genes annotated with “endoplasmic reticulum” by clicking on the tickbox on the left. Then click on Union / or. This will generate a union of both lists (genes present in either of the lists) with genes that satisfy either condition.

Still in the Combine queries table, select both union lists, and click on intersect / and. This will generate an intersection of both lists (genes present in both) with genes that satisfies both conditions.

Multiple entries are allowed, but only for cases where two or more of the same modification are known to be present at the same time. Separate entries with commas (e.g. S72,T85). Position numbering should reflect the current sequence data in JaponicusDB. Please refer to the Gene Coordinate Changes page to ensure that your residue position entries are up to date. Also note that histones are conventionally numbered assuming the initiator methionine is removed (i.e. every position in the mature protein is numbered, and is 1 less than the apparent numbering predicted by translating the ORF).\n6.  See the table below for allowed annotation extensions. Multiple extensions can be included for a modification. Separate extensions with a comma (,) if they combine to form a “compound” extension (all parts apply together), or with a pipe (|) if they are independent. You can also use separate rows for annotations with independent extensions.\n7.  The Reference column has the publication’s PubMed ID (PMID).\n8.  The taxon will usually be 4897 (the NCBI taxon ID for Schizosaccharomyces pombe), although if you have an NCBI taxon ID for a specific S. japonicus strain you are welcome to use it\n9.

For FYPO terms only, the has_part relation is also used.\n\nThe main illustrations use a GO term page. Note that not all ontology terms have all of the depicted features.\n\n[ontology term page]\n\n1.  Ontology term details. The term’s name, ID, and definition are shown.\n2.  The term’s immediate parent(s), linked to the corresponding ontology term page(s).\n3.  Links to external browsers are available for some ontologies. GO, FYPO and PSI-MOD terms have links to BioPortal, and GO term pages also link to AmiGO and QuickGO. SO IDs link to MISO.\n4.  Link to a page that lists genes annotated to the term or its descendants. From the linked page, the gene list can be sent to the advanced search for use in queries.\n5.  In the annotation summary view, the term of interest is listed first, followed by any descendant term that has direct annotations. For each term, genes (or genotypes) are listed in a compact display, with separate lines only for unique combinations of gene, term, and extension. As in the gene page summary display, most details are hidden.\n\nAs on gene pages, a more detailed annotation display is available:\n\n[ontology term page]\n\n1.  The detailed view shows one line per annotation, with separate entries for repeat determinations of a given gene/term/extension combination (if supported by more than one line of evidence and/or reported in more than one paper). The annotated gene (or genotype) is listed in the first column.\n2.  The rest of the detailed annotation display (term name, extensions, evidence, reference, etc.) is as described in the gene page documentation for each annotation type.\n3.  The table is organized into sections, one per descendant term, and each section includes genes annotated directly to the indicated term. An icon near each descendant term ID shows the relationship type that links the terms. For example, a meiotic spindle astral microtubule (GO:1990574) is a type of astral microtubule, and a mitotic spindle astral microtubule is part of an astral microtubule.\n\nFYPO term pages have a few distinctive features:\n\n[ontology term page]\n\n1.  Links near the top of the page go to lists of genes and genotypes.\n2.  The annotation display is split into single-allele and multi-allele sections, as on gene pages.\n3.

Budding yeast entries link to the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), and human genes link to HGNC; the text descriptions come from these databases. For more information, including how to search the curated orthologs, see the FAQs on budding yeast and human orthologs.\n\nThe second subsection provides links to several resources that predict orthologs in all fungi or all species (PomBase does not manually curate orthologs in species other than budding yeast and human). For further information, see the FAQ on orthologs in additional species. (Note: these links also appear in the External references section.)\n\nManual ortholog prediction methods: The human and budding yeast orthologs are manually predicted based on a variety of sources. In some cases the consensus ortholog from the major ortholog predictors (Compara, Inparanoid, OrthoMCL) is used. Many distant orthologs have also been identified by PSI-BLAST matches; these alignments have been submitted to the Pfam protein family database. Other ortholog predictions come from experimental data demonstrating functional correspondence or involving membership of corresponding complexes. These predictions are also aligned and submitted to Pfam before inclusion. JaponicusDB’s approach ensures that the breadth of coverage is greater than any individual prediction method, and includes many ortholog calls which are not detected by any automated method. Gradually, we will add and display supporting references for all orthology calls.\n\nParalogs\n\nThe Paralogs section lists any curated paralogous fission yeast genes.\n",

If you have nothing to put in one of the non-mandatory columns, include the header and leave the column blank in the rest of the rows.\n\n1.  Include the systematic ID for each gene. You can look up systematic IDs on gene pages, or refer to the file of all gene names from the dataset download page.\n2.  For help finding suitable ontology (FYPO) terms to describe your phenotypes, see the FYPO summary page and the FAQ on browsing FYPO. If you can’t find a term you need, email the helpdesk for assistance; we can add new FYPO terms as needed.\n3.  The allele description specifically describes the change; see table below.\n4.  In the Expression column, use one of these values: ‘overexpression’, ‘knockdown’, ‘endogenous’, ‘null’, ‘not specified’. Deletions should always have ‘null’ expression.\n5.  The Parental strain column is for the parental strain designation, such as 972 h-, 975 h+, etc. This column must be filled in, but you can use “unknown” if you don’t know the original background.\n6.  Use the Strain name (background) column for a lab’s in-house name/ID/designation for the background strain (i.e. the derivative of the parental strain that has selectable marker alleles etc.). The description in the Genotype column should match this background strain.\n7.  The Genotype description column is for alleles in the background, such as selectable markers; these details are optional. To avoid redundancy, do not repeat the allele of interest (from column 3 or 9) in the genotype column.\n8.  Gene names are optional. If you include them, use standard names in column 8 (see gene pages or the file of All Gene Names from the dataset download page).\n9.  Allele names are optional. If you include them, use column 9 for the preferred allele name, and put any alternative names in column 10.\n10. See note 9 above. Separate multiple entries with pipes (|).\n11. Allowed allele types, example descriptions, etc. are shown in the table below.\n12. For the Evidence column, we use a small selection from the Evidence Ontology (ECO). You are welcome to enquire with us in advance to find out which ECO terms/IDs fit your experiments, but we can accept files with brief descriptions (such as those in the Canto phenotype evidence option list), which curators will convert to ECO IDs.\n13. Similarly, Conditions use a small ontology maintained in-house by PomBase curators, and we can either advise you about which terms/IDs to use, or convert from text to IDs when we receive your file. Use multiple entries in cases where more than one condition detail applies at the same time (e.g. high temperature, minimal medium). Separate multiple entries with commas (,). Use separate lines if a phenotype is observed under more than one set of conditions (e.g. high and low temperature).\n14. Penetrance describes the proportion of a population that shows a cell-level phenotype. Use decimals, percents, or “high” (above 80%), “medium” (20-80%), or “low” (less than 20%). We will convert to suitable IDs for loading. Penetrance data will be displayed as annotation extensions on gene pages.\n15. Severity (formerly designated “expressivity) uses”high” (synonym: strong), “medium”, or “low” (synonym: weak). We will convert to suitable IDs for loading. Severity data will be displayed as annotation extensions on gene pages.\n16. The Extension column can be used to record when a mutation in one gene affects another gene or its product. For example, if a mutation in gene A decreases its ability to phosphorylate protein B, you can use the phenotype “decreased protein kinase activity” and put the ID for gene B in an extension. Multiple extensions can be included for a phenotype annotation. Separate extensions with a comma (,) if they combine to form a “compound” extension (two or more genes assayed together), or with a pipe (|) if they are independent. Most phenotype extensions will be independent and pipe-separated.\n17. The Reference column has the publication’s PubMed ID (PMID).\n18. The taxon will usually be 4897 (the NCBI taxon ID for Schizosaccharomyces pombe), although if you have an NCBI taxon ID for a specific S. japonicus strain you are welcome to use it\n19. The date is the date on which the annotations are created; you may use the paper publication date or the date on which you prepare your data file. Format: YYYY-MM-DD\n20. We can currently capture only haploid and homozygous diploid datasets via PHAF files. Allowed values for this column are “haploid” and “homozygous diploid”. If the column is empty the dataset is assumed to be haploid. If you have a phenotype dataset for non-homozygous diploids please contact the Helpdesk\n\nDetails for allele types and descriptions:\n\nGeneral note: Nucleotide and amino acid positions should reflect the current sequence data in JaponicusDB. Please refer to the Gene Coordinate Changes page to ensure that your residue position entries are up to date.\n\nFor protein-coding genes, number nucleotide residues from 1 starting with the A of the initiator ATG.\n\nFor histones, amino acid residue numbering assumes that the initiator methionine is removed.\n\nAllele type (col. 11)  Example allele description (col. 3)  Notes\n - - -\n amino acid mutation  S123A  use one-letter code; if more than one change, separate with comma(s)\n deletion  deletion  use this description for complete deletions\n nonsense mutation  K111->stop  nucleotide mutation  C123A  if more than one change, separate with comma(s)\n disruption  pab1::ura4+  expression will usually, but not always, be null\n other  RGTPI inserted after I254  include a brief text description\n partial amino acid deletion  1-100  indicate deleted residues; use comma-separated ranges for discontinuous deleted segments\n partial nucleotide deletion  500-800  indicate deleted residues; use comma-separated ranges for discontinuous deleted segments\n unknown  unknown  an allele name is required if the type and description are unknown\n wild type  wild type  use with altered expression (overexpression or knockdown) for single-allele phenotypes\n\nPlease contact the JaponicusDB curators if you have any questions about what to use for Evidence, Conditions, etc., or anything else you need to represent your data in this format.\n\nReturn to the Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology page\n",

Slims can offer a useful overview of a genome or the results of a large-scale experiment. For more information on GO slims, please see JaponicusDB GO Slimming Tips and the GO Subset Guide at the Gene Ontology website.\n\nJaponicusDB provides a GO slim term set for each major branch of GO:\n\n-  GO molecular function slim term set\n-  GO biological process slim term set\n-  GO cellular component slim term set\n\nEach fission yeast GO slim has been constructed to optimise coverage of gene products annotated to terms in the branch of GO. For the biological process and cellular component branches, coverage is almost complete; the molecular function branch has somewhat lower coverage. These slims provide good starting points for users who wish to identify terms of biological interest to create a “custom slim”, or to become familiar with the genome contents.\n\nIn the GO slim tables, GO IDs link to the QuickGO browser, where you can explore the ontology and annotations further. The annotation totals include annotations to the slim term and to descendants following the is_a, part_of, regulates, positively_regulates, and negatively_regulates relationships, and link to gene lists. (Note: the cellular component ontology does not contain any “regulates” links.)\n\nThe bottom of each GO slim page lists some simple statistics: the total number of gene products annotated to slim terms, and the number of protein-coding gene products not covered by the slim, either because they are not annotated to any term in the GO branch, or because they have annotations to terms not covered by the slim.\n\nCurrent GO slim IDs and term names can be downloaded from the JaponicusDB ftp site:\n\n-  GO molecular function slim\n-  GO biological process slim\n-  GO cellular component slim\n",

Note: this file contains annotations for single allele phenotypes (single mutants) only.\n\nThe file is in a version of the JaponicusDB phenotype data bulk annotation format (PHAF), detailed below. This format in nearly identical to the one that can be used to submit phenotype annotations to JaponicusDB in bulk, as described on the Phenotype data bulk upload format page, with the addition of the Database column. Note that, because Database is column 1 in the downloadable file, column numbers differ by 1 between the download and upload formats.\n\nPropagating phenotype annotations: Note that the file contains only direct annotations to FYPO terms. It does not include annotations that can be inferred by propagating between terms within the ontology. To make full use of the FYPO annotation data, we strongly recommend also using the ontology structure and inferred annotations. Please contact the JaponicusDB helpdesk if you need assistance.\n\nViability summary\n\nA set of “viability summary” data as shown at the top of the FYPO table on each gene page, is available as a downloadable file.

The database that produced the file – included to facilitate data sharing with other databases. Obviously always JaponicusDB for this file. (Also note that PHAF files submitted for loading can omit this column.)\n2.  The systematic ID for each gene.\n3.  To use the FYPO IDs, see the FYPO summary page and the FAQ on browsing FYPO.\n4.  The allele description specifically describes the change; see the Phenotype data bulk upload format for details on allele types and descriptions.\n5.  The Expression column contains one of these values: ‘overexpression’, ‘knockdown’, ‘endogenous’, ‘null’, ‘not specified’. Deletions always have ‘null’ expression.\n6.  The Parental strain column is for the parental strain designation, such as 972 h-, 975 h+, etc. This column must be filled in, but “unknown” is allowed.\n7.  The Background strain name column is used for a lab’s in-house name/ID/designation for the background strain (i.e. the derivative of the parental strain that has selectable marker alleles etc.). The description in the Genotype column should match this background strain.\n8.  The Background genotype description column is for alleles in the background, such as selectable markers; these details are optional. To avoid redundancy, it does not repeat the allele of interest (from column 4 or 10) in the genotype column.\n9.  Gene names are optional for upload, but are included where available in the download.\n10. Allele names are optional for upload, but are included where available in the download. Column 10 lists the preferred allele name, and any alternative names are in column 11.\n11. See note 10 above. Multiple entries are separated with pipes (|).\n12. Allowed allele types, example descriptions, etc. are shown in the table at the bottom of the Phenotype data bulk upload format page.\n13. For the Evidence column, we use a small selection from the Evidence Ontology (ECO). Please contact the Helpdesk if you need assistance using these IDs\n14. Similarly, Conditions use a small ontology maintained in-house by JaponicusDB curators, and we can help you interpret the IDs. Multiple entries are shown in cases where more than one condition detail applies at the same time (e.g. high temperature, minimal medium), and are separated with commas (,).\n15. Penetrance describes the proportion of a population that shows a cell-level phenotype. Penetrance data are represented as percents or entries from the in-house FYPO_EXT ontology (FYPO_EXT:0000001 = high; FYPO_EXT:0000002 = medium; FYPO_EXT:0000003 = low; FYPO_EXT:0000004 = full).\n16. Severity (formerly designated “expressivity”) uses the FYPO_EXT ontology described in note 15.\n17. The Extension column is used to record when a mutation in one gene affects another gene or its product. For example, if a mutation in gene A decreases its ability to phosphorylate protein B, the A allele is annotated to the phenotype “decreased protein kinase activity” with the ID for gene B in an extension. In the downloadable file, an annotation can have multiple comma-separated extensions if they combine to form a “compound” extension (e.g. two or more genes assayed together).\n18. The Reference column has the publication’s PubMed ID (PMID).\n19. The taxon will usually be 4897 (the NCBI taxon ID for Schizosaccharomyces pombe), although an NCBI taxon ID for a specific S. japonicus strain would be allowed.\n20. The date is the date on which the annotations are created. Format: YYYY-MM-DD\n21. PHAF format is only suitable for haploid and homozygous diploid phenotypes so the only possible values for this column are “haploid” and “homozygous diploid”.\n",

Paste your gene list into the “Gene names and IDs” query, and then combine it with a GO query for each term of interest (see the search documentation for more information).\n\n-  If you are interested in many GO terms, or if you do not know in advance which terms may be relevant, we recommend that you use a “GO term enrichment” tool. Such tools are typically used to find terms overrepresented for a gene list, but can be used to retrieve all GO annotations if the p-value threshold is set artificially high.\n\nBoth the Advanced Search and term enrichment tools take advantage of the hierarchical structure of GO, such that annotations to specific terms are propagated to “ancestor” terms via is_a and part_of relations. See the JaponicusDB GO documentation, and the GO Consortium documentation linked there, for more information.

See the data submission page for instructions.\n-  If you have a large set of phenotype data (e.g. from a screen of the deletion collection), especially if there are many annotations to one or a few FYPO term(s), you can send them to the helpdesk in the phenotype annotation spreadsheet format.\n-  Similarly, we can accept sets of GO, modification, or gene expression data as described on the dataset submission page.\n-  For large sets of genetic or physical interaction data, we recommend that you prepare a spreadsheet using the template provided by BioGRID (see “Step 1. Send Us Your Interaction Data”). You are welcome to send the spreadsheet either to BioGRID or to JaponicusDB (via the helpdesk); JaponicusDB and BioGRID exchange data regularly so all interactions will appear in both databases.\n\nYou can do both Canto curation and large-scale data submission for a single publication, if it reports both large- and small-scale experimental results.\n\nFor any data types not listed above, or if you have any questions, please contact the JaponicusDB helpdesk.\n",

By querying for genes annotated to either a GO term or a FYPO term, you can find genes with relevant phenotypes (including “downstream effects”) as well as genes involved in a process (with or without mutant phenotypes affecting the process).\n\nUse the union (OR operator) button in the JaponicusDB advanced search, available in the query history, as described in the advanced search documentation. For example, to find genes that affect cellular respiration, search for “FYPO:0000078 (abnormal cellular respiration)”; search for “GO:0045333 (cellular respiration)”; and then combine them in a third query. For any process, you can try using more specific or less specific terms to retrieve the results that best fit your expectations and needs.\n\nExample query: ``\n",

FYPO annotations indicate when a mutation in a gene causes a change in a process, but do not say whether the effect is direct or indirect.\n\nMany mutant phenotypes reflect downstream effects of compromising an upstream process. In these cases, we annotate the phenotypes using FYPO terms, but do not annotate to the GO corresponding biological process term. We use “regulation of biological process” GO terms in cases where there is evidence for a gene playing a regulatory role in wild-type cells, but not where defects in an upstream process affect a downstream process (even though the latter is sometimes described as “regulating” or “modulating” the downstream process).\n\nFor example, a defect in cellular respiration may arise from mutations in genes directly involved in respiration, but also as a downstream effect of mutations in genes involved in mitochondrial translation, respiratory chain complex assembly, or ubiquinone biosynthesis. Similarly, DNA replication defects often also lead to defects in chromosome segregation; for the genes involved we annotate both replication and segregation phenotypes, but only replication in GO biological process.\n\nThe cell cycle offers an even more dramatic example of why we restrict usage of GO annotations. Over 750 genes can be mutated to give an elongated vegetative cell phenotype, which is traditionally interpreted as indicating that cell cycle progression is blocked in interphase. Most of these genes, however, are involved in transcription, translation, transport or splicing, and cell cycle delays seen in mutants are due to activation of cell cycle checkpoints by the abnormal processes. To annotate all 750 genes to “regulation of mitotic cell cycle” would obscure the genes that actually are part of the cell cycle regulatory network, greatly reducing the usefulness and precision of GO annotations.\n\nAlso see the FAQ on finding genes that affect a process.\n",

Comparing results with and without the allele restrictions may help resolve apparent discrepancies.\n\nNote that it not yet possible to search for specific conditions, or for penetrance, but we plan to add these features to the Advanced Search.\n\nIf, however, the allele and condition details are identical, annotation to both viable and inviable terms is probably an error (either one of the terms is wrong, or there are missing or incorrect details for the alleles and/or conditions).

This does not guarantee that no one else will use your reserved gene name, but the naming committee will actively discourage alternative usage. If we become aware of a nomenclature conflict, we will attempt to notify all parties.\n\nGuidelines for naming S. japonicus genes\n\n1.  The gene name should consist of three italicized lower case letters (the gene symbol) followed by an integer (e.g. rad26). This will not be italicized in the database. (Note that a few historical gene names with four letters, or without an integer, have been grandfathered into the database, but all new standard gene names must conform to the three-letters-plus-integer pattern.)\n2.  The gene name registration form will return soon. To reserve a gene name in the meantime, please email the helpdesk and include the gene systematic ID, proposed gene name, name description, the relevant PubMed ID (if available), and any other information.\n3.  The 3-letter gene symbol should stand for a description of a phenotype, gene product or gene function. In addition, we strongly prefer that a given gene symbol have only one associated description, i.e., all genes which use a given 3 letter symbol should have a related phenotype, gene product or gene function. If a 3-letter symbol is already in use, it should not be used to describe a different class of genes. Before choosing your gene name, search JaponicusDB for any gene name beginning with the 3-letter symbol, by entering the 3-letter name followed by an asterisk, e.g. “cdc*”. Also check the usage of the 3-letter code in S. cerevisiae at SGD.\n4.  Please include your gene name(s) in the abstracts of any relevant papers. This simplifies the task of identifying yeast gene names that are already in use.\n5.  At the time of registration, the S. japonicus curator will check PubMed, GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ and the Gene Name Registry to ensure the gene name is unique. If your chosen gene name is not unique, you will be contacted and asked to select a new name.\n6.  Please check that the reserved gene name is still unique, and that the gene still has no other name used for it, before submitting a publication.\n7.  If it is discovered that your gene has been previously named, your gene name would instead become an alias (synonym) for the locus, and it and any associated references will remain searchable and linked to the standard locus name.\n8.  If you reserve a gene name prior to publication, and your reserved name is published referring to a different gene before your name usage is published, a compromise specific to the situation will be made. In most cases, you will NOT retain the use of the gene name unless you published the name first (see “Resolution of gene name conflicts” below).\n9.  If no conflicts arise, your gene name will become the standard name, and will appear on the gene page and elsewhere in JaponicusDB.\n\nResolution of gene name conflicts\n\nGene name conflicts in which multiple names have been used to describe one gene or, conversely, one name has been applied to multiple genes, will be resolved within 12 months. Whenever possible, all interested parties will be involved in the resolution of the conflict. We recognize that each case is unique, and we will choose the most appropriate solution using the following guidelines:\n\n1.  Researcher consensus: In the first instance, if the researchers involved in the name conflict agree to a resolution that satisfies our Gene Naming requirements, this solution will be implemented.\n2.  Literature consensus: In the absence of researcher consensus, we will examine the literature for the number of name usages and the number of different research groups utilizing a particular name usage. If there is a very obvious imbalance, we will favour the predominant name usage.\n3.  Priority: In the absence of either researcher or literature consensus, we will favour the gene name usage that was first published if this is significantly earlier. However, if papers are published simultaneously (within 3 months), the pre-registered name will become the primary name.\n4.  Relevance of the name: In rare cases where none of the above guidelines apply, we may favour a particular name usage that more accurately describes a phenotype, gene product or gene function.\n",
