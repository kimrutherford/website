<p>Registration is now open for the <a href="https://yeast2019.org">29th International Conference on Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology (ICYGMB)</a>, which returns to Gothenburg, Sweden, August 18-22, 2019.</p>
<p>Yeast2019 is the meeting of the international yeast research community where the latest, and even unpublished results are exchanged, and new projects, alliances, and collaborations are founded. Featuring 55 confirmed speakers including keynote lectures by Susan Gasser, Roger Kornberg and Frederick Roth, this conference will contain important news and information for all yeast researchers. A do-not-miss-event.</p>

<p><em>2019-02-20</em></p>
<p>Our analysis of conserved unknown proteins has now been published in <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsob.180241">Open Biology</a>. In it, PomBase curators consider the challenges and opportunities that conserved, but persistently unstudied, proteins pose for diverse areas of basic and applied biology. We develop metrics to define unknown lists, provide unknown inventories for human and yeast, and classify <em>S. pombe</em> unknowns by numerous orthogonal attributes, all with a view to drawing attention to the unknowns to alleviate their neglect.</p>
