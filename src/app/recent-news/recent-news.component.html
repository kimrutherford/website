<h4 id="revised-fission-yeast-nomenclature-for-genes-and-alleles"><strong>Revised fission yeast nomenclature for genes and alleles</strong></h4>
<p><em>2023-09-30</em></p>
<p>The improved nomenclature guidelines for fission yeast clade genes and alleles have been <a href="https://academic.oup.com/genetics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/genetics/iyad143/7283026">published in Genetics GSA</a>. This update introduces nomenclature guidelines for noncoding RNA genes, a significant update to the allele and genotype nomenclature guidelines originally published in 1987. We took several steps to improve machine readability that will benefit the artificial intelligence/machine learning communities, and our own community curation program.</p>

<p><em>2023-07-27</em></p>
<p>PomBase gene pages now include a protein feature widget. This tool shows protein features in the context of amino acid sequence. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>amino acid substitution positions</li>
<li>Pfam domains</li>
<li>protein modifications</li>
<li>protein properties: low complexity regions, disordered regions, coiled coil regions and predicted trans-membrane domains</li>

<h4 id="curation-update---nonsense-mutation-merged-into-partial-amino-acid-deletion"><strong>Curation update - “nonsense mutation” merged into “partial amino acid deletion”</strong></h4>
<p><em>2023-04-26</em></p>
<p>We have decided to merge the allele type “nonsense mutation” into “partial amino acid deletion”. This has mainly been driven by the fact that allele types that combine different variants require new types, such as “amino_acid_deletion_and_mutation”, “amino_acid_insertion_and_deletion”, etc. Otherwise, we would have ended up with many more types, and at the gene product level (which is what we describe in PomBase in phenotype interactions), both truncations are equivalent. In the next update, this allele type will not be available in Canto.</p>
<p>In any case, even if two alleles produce the same truncation, such as ase1-D13* or ase1Δ(13-731), they would still have separate entries in PomBase, and they may have different phenotypes. We are only assigning them the same allele type.</p>
<p>If for your analysis you need to make a distinction between the two using our allele dataset <a routerLink="/downloads/phenotype-annotations">allele dataset</a>, you can always check the “Allele description” field for the presence of the “*” character to tell whether an allele includes a nonsense mutation.</p>

<h4 id="experimental-structures-from-pdb-on-gene-pages"><strong>Experimental structures from PDB on gene pages</strong></h4>
<p><em>2023-02-22</em></p>
<p>The experimental protein structures from <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/">PDB</a> are now embedded on the PomBase gene pages using <a href="https://molstar.org/">Mol*</a>. For example: <a routerLink="/gene/SPCC285.12">lsm7/SPCC285.12 gene page</a></p>
<p>If you select the “PDB structures” view on a gene page, experimental structures will set as your default. AlphaFold predictions will be shown for genes where an experimental structure are not available.</p>
<p>We now also display the structures on the associated publication page. For example: <a routerLink="/reference/PMID:31010807">PMID:31010807 Garg <em>et al.</em></a></p>
<p>To help locate proteins with experimental protein structures (currently 375), we have added a new query option to the “<a routerLink="/query">Advanced search</a>”, currently under “commonly used queries”: “<a routerLink="/results/from/id/6e8401aa-bab8-48fc-bbb7-c85d13ea10a2">Proteins with PDB structures</a>”</p>

<p><em>2022-12-15</em></p>
<p>We are very pleased to announce that PomBase has been selected as one of the first <a href="https://globalbiodata.org/scientific-activities/global-core-biodata-resources">Global Core Biodata Resource (GCBR)</a> — a collection of 37 resources whose long term funding and sustainability is critical to life science and biomedical research worldwide. This accreditation recognizes PomBase as a primary knowledge base (adding value to data through expert curation) and as a crucial component of the research ecosystem. The candidate biodata resources were assessed against a series of rigorous criteria that included their scientific focus, the size and reach of their user communities, their quality of service, their governance, and their impact on global research.</p>
<p>Thank you to the entire community, especially the community curators who contribute regularly to our content, and our <a routerLink="/about/pombase-sab">Scientific Advisory Board</a> for their help and support.</p>

<p>You can now query the RNA length of genes (spliced or unspliced) under the “Transcripts and exons” query grouping in the <a href="https://www.pombase.org/query">Advanced search</a>.</p>
<p>You can also add RNA sequence length as a field in tables downloaded from the query builder.</p>

<h4 id="genetic-interaction-annotation-model-updated"><strong>Genetic Interaction annotation model updated</strong></h4>
<p><em>2022-11-29</em></p>
<p>We have recently implemented an improved way to <strong>annotate and display genetic interactions so they are linked to phenotype annotations and alleles</strong>.</p>
<p>Previously, our Genetic Interaction annotations only mentioned the interacting genes and the type of genetic interaction. For example, if a strain with genotype <code>asp1-H397A</code> has the phenotype <code>decreased acid phosphatase activity affecting activity of pho1</code>, but this phenotype is suppressed when <code>rhn1</code> is deleted in that strain, we would annotate that the genes <code>asp1</code> and <code>rhn1</code> are part of a <code>Phenotypic Suppression</code> interaction.</p>
<p><img src="assets/newsfeed/gi-update-1.png" class="screenshot" style="width:100.0%" alt="GI old format" /></p>
<p>We continue to display interactions in this format by default (showing only genes and interaction type), but if you expand the annotation, you can view the associated genotypes and phenotypes.</p>
<p><img src="assets/newsfeed/gi-update-2.png" class="screenshot" style="width:100.0%" alt="GI new format" /></p>
<p>In the revised Canto interface, you can only annotate a genetic interaction from the double mutant phenotype annotation (by clicking on <code>add..</code>, as shown below).</p>
<p><img src="assets/newsfeed/gi-update-3.png" class="screenshot" style="width:100.0%" alt="GI annotation in Canto" /></p>
<p>Of course, genetic interactions predating this update are not linked to phenotypes or genotypes, but we are hoping to auto-annotate several of those. We will also prioritise for update any interactions where community curators have provided these details in an annotation comment. Finally, <strong>a big shoutout to Ana Sanchez and Angad Garg from the Shuman lab</strong>, for testing the new interface in numerous recently curated publications. The examples provided here are from <a routerLink="/reference/PMID:31276588">Sanchez et al. 2019</a>. Go read it and see the annotations in PomBase.</p>
<p>Best, The PomBase team</p>

<h4 id="using-alphafold-models-to-discover-distant-human-and-budding-yeast-homologues"><strong>Using AlphaFold models to discover distant human and budding yeast homologues</strong></h4>
<p><em>2022-10-14</em></p>
<p>We collaborated with the Pfam group at the EBI to evaluate predictions generated from AlphaFold reciprocal best structure hits to identify potential distant orthologs. The Reciprocal Best Structure Hits (RBSH) approach provided 11 novel human homologues, including <strong>Pho86 -&gt; NAT8</strong> (ER acetyltransferase), <strong>Mug174 -&gt; COIL</strong> (Coilin), <strong>Ach1 -&gt; OXCT1</strong> (succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid coenzyme A transferase), <strong>SPAC1952.08c -&gt; CREG1</strong>, <strong>imt1 -&gt; A4GALT</strong> (Lactosylceramide 4-alpha-galactosyltransferase), <strong>Rtc5 -&gt; MEAK7</strong> (MTOR associated protein). A further 41 novel orthologs were predicted between <em>S. pombe</em> and <em>S. cerevisiae</em> which had fallen under the radar for all other methods used at PomBase. Most of the novel connections provided additional functional information, or supported existing knowledge for poorly characterised proteins. See supporting data tables S4 and S5 for the
complete list of predictions included in PomBase. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformaticsadvances/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioadv/vbac072/6749558">Article</a>.</p>
