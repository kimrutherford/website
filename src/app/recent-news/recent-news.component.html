<h4 id="angeli-update"><strong>AnGeLi update</strong></h4>
<p><em>2020-03-23</em></p>
<p>AnGeLi (developed by Danny Bitton) is a tool that allows you to perform enrichments over gene lists.</p>
<p>AnGeLi has recently been updated to provide 9320 lists, including ontology-based annotations from PomBase (as of <span class="no-break">2020-03-04</span>) as well as many additional datasets from the Bähler laboratory.</p>

<p><em>2020-03-23</em></p>
<p>The PomBase <a routerLink="/query">Advanced search</a> has added new options to the data you can download for your query results:</p>
<ul>
<li>All physical interactors of a gene product</li>
<li>Deletion viability</li>
<li>Protein length</li>
</ul>

<p><em>2020-03-01</em></p>
<p>PomBase now uses InterPro Version 77.0, which integrates 145 new methods from the CATH-Gene3D (134), and SUPERFAMILY (11) databases. InterPro cites 59894 publications in PubMed. See the InterPro <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/release_notes/">release notes</a> for further information.</p>

<p><em>2020-02-28</em></p>
<p>789/1587 publications assigned to community members for curation are finished. A big thank you to everyone who has participated so far. For more details, and all our curation metrics, see https://curation.pombase.org/pombe/stats/annotation</p>

<h4 id="a-quarter-of-a-million-annotations"><strong>A quarter of a million annotations</strong></h4>
<p><em>2020-02-20</em></p>
<p>PomBase recently reached 250,000 annotations to controlled vocabularies and ontologies. The majority (over 90%) are assigned manually from fission yeast experimental data derived from 3776 publications, most of which report low-throughput, hypothesis-driven experiments.</p>
<p>You can query and combine any of these data types in the <a href="https://www.pombase.org/query">Advanced search</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who contributed to this significant achievement through community curation.</p>

<h4 id="query-phenotypes-for-conditions"><strong>Query phenotypes for conditions</strong></h4>
<p><em>2020-02-05</em></p>
<p>The PomBase advanced search <a routerLink="/query">Advanced search</a> now supports using experimental conditions as search criteria for phenotype annotations. For example, you can now query for genes that show abnormal chromosome segregation mutant phenotypes specifically at high or low temperatures. The search uses the same condition descriptors as Canto and the PomBase web pages.</p>
<p>Note that phenotype queries that have condition constraints can be combined, but pay careful attention to the annotations for the results. Future work will add support for querying for multiple conditions on the same annotation, and for specifying conditions to exclude from results.</p>

<h4 id="pombase-is-now-an-elixir-node-service"><strong>PomBase is now an ELIXIR Node Service</strong></h4>
<p><em>2020-01-17</em></p>
<p>PomBase has been awarded Node Service status by the <a href="https://elixiruknode.org/">UK node</a> of <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/">ELIXIR</a>. ELIXIR-UK Node Services support the bioinformatics and broader biological research communities by providing training and resources that help researchers to find and share data, exchange expertise, and agree on best practices at national, European and international levels. The review panel describes PomBase as a “mature, leading model organism database which is popular, unique, well used, and has a strong user community.”</p>

<h4 id="new-vectors-for-simple-reliable-s.-pombe-molecular-biology"><strong>New vectors for simple, reliable <em>S. pombe</em> molecular biology</strong></h4>
<p><em>2020-01-07</em></p>
<p>To enable fission yeast researchers to manipulate <em>S. pombe</em> molecular biology reproducibly and easily, Aleks Vještica and Magdalena Marek in Sophie Martin’s lab have designed and constructed a series of simple, fully characterized plasmids.</p>
<p>The Stable Integration Vector (SIV) series provides a highly modular toolbox to introduce heterologous sequences more stably was possible with than previously available vectors. The toolkit includes antibiotic resistance markers, promoters, fluorescent tags, and terminators, as well as large set of ready-to-use fluorescent probes to mark organelles and visualize cellular processes.</p>
<p>The work is published in the <a href="https://jcs.biologists.org/content/early/2019/11/29/jcs.240754.long">Journal of Cell Science</a>, and a PomBase <a href="https://www.pombase.org/reference/PMID:31801797">publication page</a> is available.</p>
