<p><em>2019-02-20</em></p>
<p>Our analysis of conserved unknown proteins has now been published in <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsob.180241">Open Biology</a>. In it, PomBase curators consider the challenges and opportunities that conserved, but persistently unstudied, proteins pose for diverse areas of basic and applied biology. We develop metrics to define unknown lists, provide unknown inventories for human and yeast, and classify <em>S. pombe</em> unknowns by numerous orthogonal attributes, all with a view to drawing attention to the unknowns to alleviate their neglect.</p>

<h4 id="improved-disease-association-dataset-released"><strong>Improved disease association dataset released</strong></h4>
<p><em>2019-01-09</em></p>
<p>We are pleased to announce the release of our improved human disease mappings dataset. This dataset connects human disease causing genes to their <em>S. pombe</em> orthologs.</p>
<p>Diseases are now mapped to the Disease Ontology (DO) and the dataset has been extended by data from Malacards. All disease associations can be accessed from the <a routerLink="/term/DOID:4">top level disease page</a>. A disease slim has been created to facilitate browsing of disease categories. Currently, 907 S. pombe genes are associated with disease (up from 610 in the original dataset). This number is due to increase as mappings are still in progress.</p>
<p>Many thanks to DO and Malacards for help in improving this annotation set. Icon courtesy of <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/users/mcmurryjulie-2375405/">Julie McMurry</a>.</p>
