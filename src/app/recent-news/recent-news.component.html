<h4 id="fission-yeast-micropublications"><strong>Fission yeast microPublications</strong></h4>
<p><em>2020-07-22</em></p>
<p>PomBase has recently joined <a href="https://www.micropublication.org/">microPublication.org</a>, which “publishes brief, novel findings, negative and/or reproduced results, and results which may lack a broader scientific narrative”, as a Partner Database. Fission yeast researchers can thus now make any results available to the community, even those that don’t fit neatly into traditional publications.</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="https://www.micropublication.org/">microPublications website</a> to learn more, to <a href="https://www.micropublication.org/submit-new-article/">register</a> and submit your data, or sign up to review. Send questions to the <a href="mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org">PomBase helpdesk</a>.</p>

<p><em>2020-06-11</em></p>
<p>Entries in the <a routerLink="/query">PomBase advanced search</a> query history now show brief, user-editable query descriptions, and a toggle to show or hide additional details.</p>

<h4 id="new-fission-yeast-go-slims"><strong>New fission yeast GO slims</strong></h4>
<p><em>2020-05-20</em></p>
<p>To complement the overview provided by the <a href="/browse-curation/fission-yeast-bp-go-slim-terms">fission yeast GO biological process slim</a>, we have created GO slims for the <a href="/browse-curation/fission-yeast-mf-go-slim-terms">molecular function</a> and <a routerLink="/browse-curation/fission-yeast-cc-go-slim-terms">cellular component</a> branches of GO. Each slim page provides links to ontology term pages, annotated genes, and to download slim terms and IDs from the PomBase ftp site.</p>

<h4 id="new-ontology-slimming-options-for-advanced-search-results"><strong>New ontology slimming options for advanced search results</strong></h4>
<p><em>2020-05-20</em></p>
<p>The PomBase <a routerLink="/query">advanced search</a> results panel now allows you to retrieve annotations to any of the fission yeast <a href="documentation/pombase-go-slim-documentation">GO slims</a> or the <a href="https://www.pombase.org/browse-curation/disease-slim">Mondo disease slim</a> for genes in the results list. For example, you can query for all genes involved in a process and slim the resulting list by molecular function or disease association.</p>

<h4 id="pombase-adopts-mondo-for-disease-gene-curation"><strong>PomBase adopts MONDO for disease gene curation</strong></h4>
<p><em>2020-05-18</em></p>
<p>PomBase has switched from the <a href="https://disease-ontology.org/">Disease Ontology</a> (DO) to the Monarch Initiative’s <a href="https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/">Mondo Disease Ontology</a> (Mondo) for disease gene curation. Mondo covers the same set of disease descriptions as DO, but has a richer hierarchical structure that classifies more specific descriptions into broad categories (e.g. anemia, cancer, kidney disease) suitable for a disease “slim” term set.</p>
<p>PomBase curators are collaborating with Mondo to improve its disease classification, especially in areas that will support inferences that improve fission yeast disease annotation coverage in the new <a href="https://www.pombase.org/browse-curation/disease-slim">PomBase Mondo slim</a>. The new disease slim is a work in progress, so if there is a particular disease grouping that you would find useful, please <a href="mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org">let us know</a>.</p>

<h4 id="improved-gene-disease-curation"><strong>Improved gene-disease curation</strong></h4>
<p><em>2020-05-18</em></p>
<p>PomBase disease gene curation associates disease descriptors with fission yeast orthologs of human disease-causing genes. We have now increased coverage by adding new gene–disease term connections, with 3954 individual annotations to 1195 genes (up from 2588 and 905 respectively in January 2019). Disease associations now cover 24.5% of all fission yeast protein-coding genes, and over one third of those with human orthologs.</p>
