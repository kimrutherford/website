<p>78 protein have been shortened. This set includes 34 published proteins (Apl4, Brc1, Cdc48, Cdt1, Cho1, Cmb1, Cut2, Cut6, Cwf26, Dbr1, Dri1, Elo2, Eri1, Lsd2, Lys2, Med13, Naa38, Nup107, Nup82, Orc2, Pof10, Ppt1, Rec24, Rga2, Rmt3, Rns1, Rpn7, Sap145, Skb1, Snf5, Snt2, Spn3, Tpp2, Trm1, and Tup12).</p>

<h4 id="new-phenotype-slim"><strong>New phenotype slim</strong></h4>
<p><em>2022-04-13</em></p>
<p>We have added a <a routerLink="/browse-curation/fypo-slim">phenotype slim overview</a> to complement those provided for <a routerLink="/browse-curation/disease-slim">disease association</a>, <a routerLink="/browse-curation/fission-yeast-bp-go-slim-terms">biological process</a>, <a routerLink="/browse-curation/fission-yeast-mf-go-slim-terms">molecular function</a> and <a routerLink="/browse-curation/fission-yeast-cc-go-slim-terms">cellular component</a> annotation. The purpose of the phenotype slim is to provide subsets of commonly used ‘broad’ phenotypic classes or annotation subsets that can provide a useful starting point for accessing phenotype lists. The phenotype slim page provides links to ontology term pages, annotated genes, and to download files containing the slim terms and IDs.</p>
<p>The phenotype slim has also been added to the PomBase <a routerLink="/query">advanced search</a> results panel “Slim with” menu. For example, you can query for all genes involved in a GO process, another phenotype, or any other list, and “slim” the results using the “Phenotype slim” option to view categories of phenotypes assigned to the list.</p>

<h4 id="the-fission-yeast-community-have-now-curated-over-1000-publications"><strong>The fission yeast community have now curated over 1000 publications</strong></h4>
<p><em>2022-03-26</em></p>
<p>We would like to extend a huge “thank you” to the fission yeast community for curation contributions. The community have now curated 1008 publications providing 19,156 independent annotations, representing 25% of the curation from small-scale publications. In addition, another 80,000 annotations have been provided via the submission of HTP datasets.</p>
<p>Please contact us <a href="mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org?subject=New%20manuscript%20for%20curation">via the helpdesk</a> if you would like to provide curation for your manuscript but don’t know how.</p>
