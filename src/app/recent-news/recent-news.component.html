<h4 id="published-community-curation-in-pombase"><strong>Published: Community curation in PomBase</strong></h4>
<p><em>2020-05-11</em></p>
<p>The PomBase team has published an overview of our experience with community curation for fission yeast. In the article, out this week in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/baaa028/5827230">Database</a>, we reflect on the factors that have made our community’s remarkable, standard-setting achievements possible, and on the benefits we and PomBase users derive from this effort. We highlight the collaboration between authors and professional curators that arises via community curation, and how annotation quality improves as a result.</p>

<h4 id="chromatin-silencing-ontology-annotation-overhaul"><strong>Chromatin silencing ontology &amp; annotation overhaul</strong></h4>
<p><em>2020-05-07</em></p>
<p>PomBase curators have collaborated with the GO Consortium to improve the representation of chromatin silencing and the underlying heterochromatin organization processes in the GO biological process ontology and annotations.</p>
<p>Notably, “chromatin silencing” terms have been removed from GO on the grounds that they conflated various heterochromatin assembly, formation, and maintenance pathways with processes that affect chromatin-mediated repression more indirectly (e.g. tethering to the nuclear envelope). Chromatin silencing is a phenotype resulting from the cumulative effects of these processes, and the Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO) accordingly retains a full suite of “chromatin silencing” terms.</p>
<p>Annotations using the GO chromatin silencing terms were reviewed, and either removed or reannotated based on what could be inferred from the phenotypes, resulting in a substantially revised set of <a href="https://www.pombase.org/term/GO:0031507">heterochromatin assembly annotations</a>. Further work is required, so please <a href="mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org">send us</a> any corrections.</p>
