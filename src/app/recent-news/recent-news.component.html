<h4 id="query-phenotypes-for-conditions"><strong>Query phenotypes for conditions</strong></h4>
<p><em>2020-02-05</em></p>
<p>The PomBase advanced search <a routerLink="/query">Advanced search</a> now supports using experimental conditions as search criteria for phenotype annotations. For example, you can now query for genes that show abnormal chromosome segregation mutant phenotypes specifically at high or low temperatures. The search uses the same condition descriptors as Canto and the PomBase web pages.</p>
<p>Note that phenotype queries that have condition constraints can be combined, but pay careful attention to the annotations for the results. Future work will add support for querying for multiple conditions on the same annotation, and for specifying conditions to exclude from results.</p>

<p><em>2020-01-17</em></p>
<p>PomBase has been awarded Node Service status by the <a href="https://elixiruknode.org/">UK node</a> of <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/">ELIXIR</a>. ELIXIR-UK Node Services support the bioinformatics and broader biological research communities by providing training and resources that help researchers to find and share data, exchange expertise, and agree on best practices at national, European and international levels. The review panel describes PomBase as a “mature, leading model organism database which is popular, unique, well used, and has a strong user community.”</p>

<h4 id="new-vectors-for-simple-reliable-s.-pombe-molecular-biology"><strong>New vectors for simple, reliable <em>S. pombe</em> molecular biology</strong></h4>
<p><em>2020-01-07</em></p>
<p>To enable fission yeast researchers to manipulate <em>S. pombe</em> molecular biology reproducibly and easily, Aleks Vještica and Magdalena Marek in Sophie Martin’s lab have designed and constructed a series of simple, fully characterized plasmids.</p>
<p>The Stable Integration Vector (SIV) series provides a highly modular toolbox to introduce heterologous sequences more stably was possible with than previously available vectors. The toolkit includes antibiotic resistance markers, promoters, fluorescent tags, and terminators, as well as large set of ready-to-use fluorescent probes to mark organelles and visualize cellular processes.</p>
<p>The work is published in the <a href="https://jcs.biologists.org/content/early/2019/11/29/jcs.240754.long">Journal of Cell Science</a>, and a PomBase <a href="https://www.pombase.org/reference/PMID:31801797">publication page</a> is available.</p>

<p><em>2019-10-07</em></p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that the recent PomBase application for continued Wellcome Trust funding was successful. Although the grant was not fully funded, we are confident that we can cover the shortfall by small grants for stand-alone projects and collaborations. We would like to thank the pombe community for their support with the application, and the Wellcome Trust for their continued funding. We look forward to supporting your research until 2025 (and beyond).</p>
