<p><em>2020-09-02</em></p>
<p>In collaboration with the GO Consortium, the PomBase team has published a report on the <strong>Term Matrix</strong> approach to GO annotation quality control. The article, out this week in <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsob.200149">Open Biology</a>, describes biological processes that do, or don’t, share annotated gene products, and how we use co-annotation patterns to build rules to detect, correct, and prevent errors.</p>

<p>PomBase has recently joined <a href="https://www.micropublication.org/">microPublication.org</a>, which “publishes brief, novel findings, negative and/or reproduced results, and results which may lack a broader scientific narrative”, as a Partner Database. Fission yeast researchers can thus now make any results available to the community, even those that don’t fit neatly into traditional publications.</p>
