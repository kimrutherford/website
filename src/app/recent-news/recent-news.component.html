<h4 id="s.-pombe-gene-list"><strong><em>S. pombe</em> gene list</strong></h4>
<p><em>2019-04-16</em></p>
<p><em>S. pombe</em> gene information is now included in the <a href="https://gene-info.org/">Gene Info</a> extension (GIX) for the Chrome and Firefox web browsers. GIX allows you to retrieve information about a gene product directly on any webpage simply by double clicking an official gene name, synonym or supported accession. Searching or double-clicking on text terms retrieves gene function annotation, GO terms, external database links, and interaction data drawn from BioGRID and IntAct. Retrieved gene names are automatically hyperlinked for rapid recursive searches.</p>
<p>GeneInfo is fully open source, available online at <a href="https://github.com/knightjdr/gene-info/">GitHub</a>. Tutorial videos, a step-by-step guide, and download links for Firefox Add-ons and the Chrome web storeare available <a href="https://gene-info.org/">online</a>. GeneInfo was developed by James Knight in the <a href="https://gingraslab.lunenfeld.ca/">Gingras Lab</a> at the <a href="http://www.lunenfeld.ca/">Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute</a> in Toronto, Canada.</p>

<p><em>2019-03-13</em></p>
<p>Registration is now open for the <a href="https://yeast2019.org">29th International Conference on Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology (ICYGMB)</a>, which returns to Gothenburg, Sweden, August 18-22, 2019.</p>
<p>Yeast2019 is the meeting of the international yeast research community where the latest, and even unpublished results are exchanged, and new projects, alliances, and collaborations are founded. Featuring 55 confirmed speakers including keynote lectures by Susan Gasser, Roger Kornberg and Frederick Roth, this conference will contain important news and information for all yeast researchers. A do-not-miss-event.</p>

<p><em>2019-03-05</em></p>
<p>PomBase's advanced search now allows you to retrieve <a href="documentation/pombase-go-slim-documentation">GO slim</a> annotations for any set of search results. To find GO slim annotations for your own list of <em>S. pombe</em> genes, use the advanced search &quot;Gene IDs&quot; option, and then use the &quot;Slim&quot; button on the search results page.</p>

<p><em>2019-03-04</em></p>
<p>Registration is now open for the <a href="https://petitinstitute.gatech.edu/serym-2019">26th annual South Eastern Regional Yeast Meeting (SERYM)</a>, which will be held April 12-14, 2019, in Atlanta, GA, USA.</p>
<p>Fission yeast's own Susan Forsburg is the keynote speaker. The meeting brings together researchers who use any type of yeast as a model system, covering diverse, interdisciplinary topics from strategies for treatment of fungal disease to modeling human disease in yeast.</p>

<p><em>2019-02-20</em></p>
<p>Our analysis of conserved unknown proteins has now been published in <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsob.180241">Open Biology</a>. In it, PomBase curators consider the challenges and opportunities that conserved, but persistently unstudied, proteins pose for diverse areas of basic and applied biology. We develop metrics to define unknown lists, provide unknown inventories for human and yeast, and classify <em>S. pombe</em> unknowns by numerous orthogonal attributes, all with a view to drawing attention to the unknowns to alleviate their neglect.</p>
